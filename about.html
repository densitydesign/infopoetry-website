            <p>The Final Synthesis Design Studio is a mandatory course open to students attending the last year of the
                M.Sc. degree in Communication Design at Politecnico di Milano. During the course students learn to
                observe, describe and represent controversial phenomena – such as migration, climate change, hate speech
                – from different perspectives, performing (data-driven) analyses and visually communicating the results.

            <p>In this context, Communication Design is used to access and understand the increasingly complex amount of
                data and information shaping our world. Students are invited to use visualisation techniques across
                multiple phases of the research process: to describe and understand the observed phenomena; to share
                methods and results; as a strategy for public engagement.</p>
