metaphor: >-
  The cultural identity and the oral tradition disappear when people leave their
  place. Representing popular songs as habitants in a fingerprint, a form of
  union, let us understand the effect of time that turns into an empty paper
  making the traditions forgotten.
meaning: >-
  To make people aware about the depopulation in rural regions and to evoke the
  memory of their ancestors, places of origin and traditions. The goal is also
  to pay attention on how traditional customs and culture are getting lost
  without people even being aware of it.

Focusing on the tendency of rural depopulation in Spain, especially in the region of Zamora, this work shows how people lose their traditions, identity and oral transmission. With the decreasing of the population, union disappears, emptiness comes and the stories of the land start to be forgotten.
