A volleyball team has to face many situations during a game: serve, reception, set, spike, defence, block. These actions generate points or errors, leading to victory or defeat. During a match, the quality of each action is often evaluated using 5 parameters: very good (leads to a point by spike, serve or block), good, decent, bad, very bad (always gives the point to the opposite team). These infographic was made using the data of an italian volleyball team, collected in 2013/2014. Each column represents a game; the lenght of the rectangles shows the recurrence of the actions by percentage. Some block and defence data are missing in a couple of games.
