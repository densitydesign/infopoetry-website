  name: Internet activities, including likes, shares, comments, etc, from Meta
    platforms.
metaphor: "Portraits are a traditional means of capturing the essence of
  individuals. In this context, this metaphor serve to highlight the
  individuality of each topic within my digital identity and the perspective of
  algorythms: the point of view that they have on me.My digital double will be
  then portrayed as a gallery filled with diverse collection of portraits. Each
  portrait represents a different topic or interest, and the style, size, and
  prominence of each portrait convey the emotional significance of that topic."
meaning: The aim is to encourage observers to reflect on their own relationship
  with their digital footprint and how it impacts their everyday life,
  considering both their rational and their emotional point of view. Is it
  familiarity, strangeness or fear?Lastly, i mean to communicate a sense of
  uncannyness, a good trigger to stimulate people's feelings about the
  algorithmical definition of self.

Algorithms defined a highly defined list of what are my interests in order to target adv and sponsorships more accurately. Some of them are extremely accurate, others are just wrong, some of them are right but I didn’t even know I was interested in them. Starting from this list I’ll add humanity to this data, giving and transforming this text into a prompt. This will then be prompted to Midjourney and elaborated on a portrait of myself. Conclusively, I will group all the fragments of my digital double in a video that will display a project will also be accessible through a QR code leading to a webapp, where all the topics, prompts and paintings and will be displayed.
