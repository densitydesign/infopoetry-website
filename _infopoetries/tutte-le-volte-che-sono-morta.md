  name: Google history of the last twelve months on searching for symptoms and
    illnesses.
metaphor: Through the metaphor of death, which is often counted among the
  consequences of illnesses or symptoms sought on the Internet, the nonsense of
  the psychological mechanism behind cyberchondria is finally revealed. Doctor
  Google is no longer just a digital oracle, but also the pharmaceutical company
  that provides cures for any symptom, which always seem to lead to death.
meaning: The intention is to ironically defuse my hypochondria or that of
  anxious people like me by making it clear how absurd it is that in the digital
  world from a trivial symptom one always arrives at a catastrophic sentence.

How easy is it, in the digital sphere, for a hypochondriac or anxious person to fall into a vicious circle of deadly and harmful selfdiagnoses based on common symptoms (cyberchondria)? A series of medicine bottles has been devised, each named after the symptom entered in the Google search bar. Attached to each vial is a leaflet that collects all the searches I have made and their “fatal” diagnoses over the past twelve months, judged from the search results. The drug ironically tries to draw attention to the issue of digital selfdiagnosis and “all the times I’ve died”.
