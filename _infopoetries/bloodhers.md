metaphor: >-
  A puzzle is a big unit composed by small pieces. The Italian situation of
  blood donation is very similar, because each region donates units of blood and
  the sum of all these parts covers our territory. If some pieces missed, the
  puzzle wouldn't be completed and the country isn't able to reach the
  self-sufficiency. 
meaning: >-
  This artifact has to inform the people about the amount of blood donations,
  because this kind of data is very important, but not so popular. Moreover, it
  wants to sensitize the audience, showing a lack.
