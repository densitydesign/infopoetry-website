metaphor: >-
  1. The measuring function of the tape measure itself have connection with the
  theme I want to express. They are all measuring, recording, and comparing
  work.

  2. The label, scale, etc. of the tape measure can provide me with space to convey information.

  3. The tape measure is small in size, simple to modify, easy to purchase, and not easy to be damaged.
meaning: >-
  Each of us has a difference between closeness and distance in social
  relationships, which is also called ""attitude towards people."" Our attitudes
  towards different people in life are different. In reality, it was originally
  a vague, abstract, non-quantifiable, and even imperceptible thing. It was
  hidden in a large number of our fleeting words. However, after the emergence
  and popularization of social media, our

  Social interaction began to migrate from reality to the online world. Today, online social interaction has become a very important part of human social interaction, and these fleeting words can be recorded, stored and used as a data source in the online world for a long time.


  So is it possible to find a way to quantify and concrete the originally abstract ""attitude""?

I try to concrete my different attitudes towards different people and see how my attitudes changed on Wechat by analyzing real chat records.In Measuring attitude, I calculate the number of days of chatting, the number of words, and the length of the chat box,finally convert them into information on a tape measure. The length of the tape measure represents the length of the dialog box in the chat. By combining all those information, I can clearly see how different people are treated by me on WeChat. Although social media cannot represent all of me, as my online avatar, it can allow me to re-examine and objectively understand my true selves from a new perspective.
