metaphor: The infopoetry consisting of hyperrealistic oil paintings plays with
  the ambiguity between photograph and painting by focusing on the contrasting
  theme of natural-artificial. The painting resembles a photograph that fixes
  reality in a specific image. The repetition of the same subject moves the
  attention on the color of the sunset, which is the only difference between the
  three canvases, suggesting the viewers the theme to observe.
meaning: "I would like to emphasise the interesting contrast of this situation:
  sometimes what we mostly appreciate as a “natural miracle” is caused by our
  own negative operations. My communication intention is therefore to make
  people more aware of the causes of this phenomenon and to think about other
  similar tricky situations."

Astonishing warm sunsets often surround our landscapes, actually, the main cause is air pollution. Small molecules, suspended in the air (aerosols) scatter more the short wavelengths and plus “Reyleigh Scattering”, generate red sunsets. Each painting is a sunset with a level of air pollution.
