metaphor: >-
  The metaphor aims to evocate a physical mutation through the flexibility of
  foam rubber. It adapts its shape on every solicitation: the more it is
  tightened, the more it becomes compact and resistant. At the same time, each
  undamaged bacterial wall is represented by a wax layer.
meaning: >-
  Antibiotic resistance is an alarming phenomenon, that people still ignore.
  Since the effects of antibiotics in our bodies are hard to detect due to the
  fact that they are not visible, this physical representation helps to actually
  see the problem, and to touch it with hands.

Antibiotics, indispensable for infections' defense, are losing their effectiveness. The excessive consumption of these medicines in the community is favoring mutations in the bacteria and their survival. 
Each object shows the percentage of antibiotic resistance per European country, in 2018.
