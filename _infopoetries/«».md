The four Gospels are among the most widespread and emblematic books of the Christian tradition, through the account of the life of Christ through the voice of the evangelists, represent a direct link between the faithful and Jesus. The project is intended as a tribute to punctuation, the content of the evangelical books has left room for a void, the words have been deleted and only the punctuation of the stories of the evangelists becomes the subject of the pages of the book. The importance of punctuation is not limited to the separation of sentences, the visual book translates the communicability of signs, making visible what is already present. Between the pages of the book the signs acquire value, are displayed in their complexity, and the "reading" of the verses leads to a new way of seeing the text. The relationships and contrasts of the same story become readable by the distribution, quantity and use of signs. The project builds a different reading of the life of Christ, illustrated by the questions and doubts of John, the exclamations of Matheus and the speeches of Luke. Enjoy reading!
