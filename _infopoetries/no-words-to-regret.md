How many Christians were persecuted in the world in 2017? The intention of the project is to let people try the impossibility of professing and sharing one's faith worship freely. Through the Holy Bible, it will be possible to find pages with deleted parts of the text. All pages showing the highest number of signs and coverages represent the degree of violence and persecution suffered in that country, among all the names on the list of the fifty most at risk.
