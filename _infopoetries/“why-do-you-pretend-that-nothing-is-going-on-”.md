  As a metaphors, I would like to:

  Make the cards double sided. This way there is always a back side, which is usually hidden from view.

  One side shows how others see my life, and the other side shows what no one else sees.

  Create a board of memories with chaotic intertwining that would characterize my thoughts and inner state in general. Pleasant memories are intertwined with feelings of dread and fear for loved ones.
meaning: >-
  War is a difficult topic, so many people avoid it. But as a Ukrainian, I
  simply have no choice not to hear about the war. It touches me and my loved
  ones every day. 


  Since the war started, a lot of people don't know how to communicate with me and don't understand how I feel and how to approach this sensitive issue correctly. 

  So I want to show what my life consists of now.


  One day I was asked: "Why do you pretend that nothing is going on and keep living your life as usual?”. This hurts me a lot as I am continuing to live not as usual as it may seem.

  With this project I want to convey that you should not judge a person by what you see, because most likely you don't know what's inside and what's in his thoughts.

My infopoetry is a frame with chaotically interwoven threads inside on which the picture cards are attached. It's like a memory board that reflects my inner state. The cards are double sided, so there is always a back side that is usually hidden from view. One side shows how people see my life and the other side shows what no one else sees.

In this way, pleasant memories are intertwined with an overwhelming sense of dread.
