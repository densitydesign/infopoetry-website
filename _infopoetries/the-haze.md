  This infopoetry wants to make audiences to feel the suffocating sensation when
  the plastic wrap increase, just like the haze makes people cannot breathe. The
  plastic wrap represents the haze, the more plastic wrap covered the more
  people cannot breathe and with the human face shape becomes blurred, it is
  like the peopleÊ¼s sight in the haze, we cannot see clearly. Background sounds
  with the breath becomes heavier. I will show the average PM2.5 air pollution
  levels in Beijing of each year at the bottom of each scene. 
meaning: >-
  This video I want to make the audience feel the sense of suffocation from the
  sensory real feeling, pay attention to the air pollution problem, and realize
  the seriousness of the air pollution problem.
