"This work aims to deepen a theme that currently has a strong hold on public opinion and is a source of great discussion. Since 1934 the Italian state has introduced the "excise duties" on petrol, which are already added to the VAT and with which they are added to the cost of the raw material to finally become the actual cost of the product to the consumer.
The fact analysed here will be that of excise duties. In fact, these are taxes that in history have been introduced by the state to deal with contingent problems and often generated by unexpected and major problems. In order to repay the state expenses, it has been chosen to subdivide the investment into so many micro parts that are attributed to the state monopolies, among which the gasoline.
