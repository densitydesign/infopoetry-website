Babies are 50 cm height when they come to life, in 3 years they become 90 cm. They grow for the 80% of their own height, and then the growing decreases until it stops at the age of 24. What would happen if we had grow that speed until 24? We could grow 54 meter, more than a normal building. The result is reached with a simple moltiplication (height*80%+ height). If you multiply it 8 times you reach 5484 cm.
