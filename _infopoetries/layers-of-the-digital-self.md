metaphor: Layers - represent the different aspects of the digital identity and
  the content we engage with on online platforms such as YouTube, and Pinterest.
  Each "layer" signifies a unique facet of online self, influenced by the
  recommendations and interactions on these platforms. The metaphor illustrates
  that your online identity is constructed, not static. It's influenced by the
  content you engage with, the algorithms that recommend it, and your
  interactions with others on digital platforms.
meaning: I want to figure out how my online activities and the things I like
  shape who I am online. By looking at how I use the internet, I hope to learn
  more about what makes me 'me' in the digital space.
