  name: Meta information files from Instagram account usage.
metaphor: Using Instagram's tracking pixel as a metaphor is a way to represent
  the existence of an "information drain" or a "window" through which our
  personal information is going and being manipulated without our consent, on
  purpose. That creates another dimension, invisible and unreachable to us, but
  with our own trail of online interactions.
meaning: In my opinion bringing to discussion the intentionally hidden tracking
  pixel mechanism is extremely important in the context of a society that can't
  be disassociated with the online world anymore. With my project I want to
  incite awareness and critical thoughts about the way the notion of online
  privacy just an illusion and it's being violated right in front of our eyes
  without us being able to see it.

“A pixel for your thoughts” uses Instagram’s  tracking pixel technology as a metaphor to how the social media platform monitors its users’ online browsing behavior to gather information without their consent. This mechanism is a 1x1 pixel embedded in the HTML code, while designed to be transparent or camouflaged in the background color of the website, so that they don’t stand out to users. Consequently, the more we interact online on Instagram, the more a tracking pixel can not only learn about our personality, but also provide that information to advertisement companies for sales purposes.
