metaphor: >-
  The metaphor is realised with 10 wooden panels (20x30 cm), one for each year
  taken into account. On each panel is laser engraved the outline of Italy
  divided by regions. On each panel, the percentage of forests covered by fire
  in each region is represented by various levels of laser engraving. The more
  the area is affected by the fire, the deeper the engraving will be on the
  panel.
meaning: >-
  The spectator can perceive the phenomenon both visually and olfactorily; the
  laser engraving, in fact, releases the smell of burnt on the wood.

  The intention is to provoke the viewer who will then find himself using two
  different senses, making him more involved and closer to the work. The
  sensation to be felt is that of disturbance, sense of alarm but above all
  anger towards this phenomenon, which every year devastates our precious lands.

The boards show the phenomena of wood fires that burn several hectares of green in Italy, replacing it with the scorched ground. Each region is carved with a density proportional to the percentage of the area interested by the fire. Holding the boards in the hand itâ€™s possible to perceive the smell of burnt.
