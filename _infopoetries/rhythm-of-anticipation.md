  name: IPhone screen time data collected between October 9th and 21st, 2023.
metaphor: Using the metaphor of a "buffering Screen," the project visually
  represents the habitual act of checking for notifications. The screen
  undergoes a continuous transition, reflecting the repetitive nature of pickups
  without substantial notifications. It remains in a perpetual state of
  buffering, symbolizing the unproductive cycle. Occasionally, when a
  notification occurs, the screen distinctly transforms, highlighting the
  infrequent moments of meaningful content within the persistent anticipation.

  Presenting a perspective on the inverse correlation between Instagram pickups
  and notifications, the project aims to underscore the influence of personal
  anticipation on digital behavior. The central argument posits that an increase
  in Instagram pickups frequently corresponds to a decrease in received
  notifications, substantiated by data analysis. Delving into the psychological
  aspects, the incorporation of poetry and visual elements serves to articulate
  the emotional dimensions, emphasizing the notion

  that our yearning for notifications significantly shapes our behavioral patterns. The intention is to provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between anticipation, digital actions, and the emotional responses embedded within this dynamic.

The focus is on understanding the emotional
and psychological dimensions of digital
dependencies. Specifically, the data research
examines the frequency of phone pickups
throughout the day, in which the immediate
attention is given to Instagram. In exploring
this habit, a noticeable disproportion emerges
between the frequency of phone pickups
and the actual notifications received. In this
relationship between digital behavior and
emotional responses, ‘Rhythm of Anticipation’
is a visual and poetic narrative that captures the
essence of anticipation, revealing the patterns
and nuances of phone usage in the context of
notification expectations.
