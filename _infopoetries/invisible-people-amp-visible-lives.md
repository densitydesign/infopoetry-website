metaphor: >-
  It’s such a huge number of people died in the Nanjing Massacre Even hard for
  us to figure out the specific numbers. Because matchsticks show a person's
  characteristics, In the aspect of morphology, it is like a kind of abstract
  appearance and the match is in a state of the burned body, In addition,
  matches can represent those who have appeared in the battlefield. 
meaning: >-
  I want to make people realize that our peaceful life is not easy to achieve.
  Let us oppose violence, oppose robbing, and oppose crimes that despise life.
  Our lives, our today's and tomorrow's world are worthy of respect. Those
  people who died on the battlefield of World War 2 are not meaningless.
