Is black metal really so black? Here it’s shown how many times the words “black”, “dark”, “svart” and “mørk” (the corresponding norwegian terms) appear in the lyrics of black metal albums. The list of bands is taken from the Wikipedia page Early Norwegian black metal scene (four bands are omitted because of missing data). The blackest the circle, the blackest the album.
