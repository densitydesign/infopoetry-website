  name: Photos from my phone album
metaphor: Image pixel
meaning: I find a lot of photos taken in my daily life in my phone albums. There
  are many moments in life that I want to capture, but I don't want to share
  them all on social media platforms. There is a huge gap between who we are on
  social media platforms and who we are. This massive information gap caught my
  attention.

The photos in our social media reveal our digital identity. In this project, what I am trying to do is to demonstrate the difference between the daily life captured by my phone and the life shown on social media and discuss the era of information explosion, which is the real me?
