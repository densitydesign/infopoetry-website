China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases and Chinese people are suffering from the toxic smog mainly caused by the burning of coal. Beijing the capital of China is also shrouded in the haze. In 2016, 40% of the year are polluted. I used the cardiograph as a metaphor, represents the sickness of the city. The sound of the heavy breath and cough follows the rhythm of the data (Air quality index) dynamic changes.
