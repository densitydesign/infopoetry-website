  Pantone colour chart in which a page represents a language and to each

  The aim of this infopoetry is to make people reflect that there are cultures
  (and consequently languages) that do not consider certain colours, and
  therefore what are the common colours in each culture.

How do you name this colour? As you can expect, different languages have different words for colours. But not all languages have the same number of terms, for example, some have 12 colours, some others only 3. What are the differences between each culture? This is what this infopoetry wants to show.
