The metaphor I decided to use to represent the tweets is the match. The match is a small tool that catches fire in a short time and is basically a means to achieve another end (you do not usually light the matches just for the sake of doing so, you do it to light a cigarette or a fire). Similar to the match, the tweets are messages of few words and have been used by the two candidates as an instrument of persuasion in order to continually rekindle the debate around the candidates themselves allowing them to gain the attention of the electorate.
