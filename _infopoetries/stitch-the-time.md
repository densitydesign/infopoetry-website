  name: This work is founded on my time data from "Animal Crossing" during my
    quarantine period in 2020 from March to April. In these 30 days, I consumed
    210 hours on this game and dived into this virtual world.
metaphor: This artefact will narrate my 210-hours gaming times during the 30
  days. I'll play the role of storyteller to summarise my movements into eight
  groups with different patterns and then represent them in the installation and
  textures. Jigsaw = split the time into pieces This can be the best way to
  represent my feeling of time during that basic situation.
meaning: >-
  Everything has texture, and time also exists. My manifesto is to transform my
  sensation of time into materials visually via textures and coloured shapes to
  illustrate my memories and feelings of time during gaming.

  All the playing messages were documented as images/screenshots in chatboxes with friends, posts and stories.

Time often exists in flow, where mine is stored as a patchwork and sewed in minds.
'Stitch the Time' illustrates the amount of time involved in the production of this tufting artwork, correspondingly showcasing the time (210 hours) I spent on the game 'animal crossing' during quarantine in 2020.
