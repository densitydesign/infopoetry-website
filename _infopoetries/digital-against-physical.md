  Two stacks of broken and destroyed CDs, placed one above the other, to
  represent a bar chart. One for the year 2017 and uni for the year 2018. Above
  them, a gelatinous mass of green slime that represents Spotify: the largest
  and most famous music streaming platform in the world. The height of the CD
  stack and the amount of gelatinous slime will be decided according to the
  dataset

  This is for sure a known phenomenon, people are aware that the value of music
  streaming services are surpassing the physical industry, but does not know
  that this industry is slowly dying because of that. More and more artists are
  declaring that they will no longer produce physical records and that they will
  limit themselves to digital streams. We are facing a new musical era, it is
  happening here and now. My intention is to inform the user through a short
  shocking video, transmit violence and violation. The loss of the old in favor
  of the new. The loss of the body in favor of the intangible.

The focus of the project is to inform the user about how much the music industry has been changing in recent years, with an exponential increase in the revenue generated by streaming and digital downloads, which are slowly making the physical CDs, that we have always known, disappear.
