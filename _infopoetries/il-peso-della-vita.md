The infopoetry wants to represent the pregnancies, and their course, within a year in Italy. The data refer to the year 2014 but are almost constant also in the following years. The submerged stones hanging from the red threads represent the total number of documented pregnancies in Italy. What happens to them is instead the course that they have had, the threads cut are the voluntary abortions, the stones that emerge from the water are the children actually came into the world while the submerged stones are the miscarriages occurred.
