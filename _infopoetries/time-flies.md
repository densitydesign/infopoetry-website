  Using scenes of real life to describe every age of life, from 1 to 100,
  combined with a different text block that helps the audience to understand the
  topic and know more about it. The project wants to focus also on those that
  are the main causes of this phenomenon, related in general to the number of
  things that fills everyday life and creates a routine. To do that it will have
  from the beginning different sounds related to the images shown in every
  scene, that slowly will combine through them, creating an effect that would
  describe the bigger amount of things to think about that grows related to age
  and creates a routine that dramatically “slows down” the time perceived. The
  combination of sounds would focus also on the fact that when you’re young
  everything is more clear, new, every day is a discovery that remains strongly
  in memory. 
meaning: >-
  The info poetry wants to provoke a deep reflection in the viewer, in a quite
  dramatic way. The intention is to make the viewer thinking about the
  importance of time and to reflect that at the end it is possible to slow down
  this physiological perception also when you are getting older, always trying
  new experiences, going out from the routine.

The perception of the speed time changes through the years: it becomes faster according to our growth. This infopoetry wants to convey the differences of speed between ages through the "projecton" of different images, 12 for every year analyzed according to the months, that refer to a life spent.
