  A rose will be the main character of the video, a symbol of love, but also of
  fragility. The distance is represented by a lack of physical contact between
  the two people that are watering the flower during the whole video and by the
  use of different watering cans used to water it.

  The video will emphasize the different stages of love during a long-distance
  relationship. My intention is to highlight that having a long-distance
  relationship is difficult but not impossible, and more people than we can
  imagine have been already through it and succeeded.

A long-distance relationship is a romantic relationship between people who live far apart. A common belief is that these relationships do not succeed over time. This project highlights that more couples succeed than the ones that not. Surprising no?
