Young people still at home is a provocation; it is about young people from 25 to 34 years old that still live at home with their parents in European Communityâ€™s countries. This phenomenon is increasing since economic crisis started and this project emphasizes the link between that problem and economic policies established by the European Parliament. 'Le Berlaymont', headquarters building of the European Parliament, represents those economic policies, while countries are highlighted through their ags. Percentage values, on the right of the graphic composition, show results of this situation.
