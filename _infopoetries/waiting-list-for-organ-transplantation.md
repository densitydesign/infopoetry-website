The aim of the artifact is to reflect on the existence of long waiting lists for the reception of an organ transplant in Italy. The infopoetry is composed of a series of 5 tables, one for each organ, where the materials, the graphic treatment and the general presentation used are aimed at simulating a radiographic examination. The print was in fact made on transparent acetate paper and each of the plates is placed inside an envelope from the clinical report. Each table shows the number of people waiting for the transplant of a specific organ, through the positioning of individual points, each representing a patient waiting. These are arranged in such a way as to form the outline of the organ taken in the analysis. A visual device that, through the relationship between full and empty space, underlines the impossibility, on the part of waiting patients, to obtain a transplant in the immediate future.
