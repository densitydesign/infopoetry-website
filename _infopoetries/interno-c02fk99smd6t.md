  name: Trackers who requested and accessed my data during 120 seconds on Safari
    on 27 November 2023, collected using Little Snitch.
metaphor: The metaphor used is to see your data as you home and the trackers
  that try to access your data as strangers trying to access your home.
meaning: >-
  The point of view of this artefact is that everyday your data are on a world
  trip, talking to strangers all over the world.

  You don't realize it because it is a silent and non directly visible action.

  The intention is to make the visitor feel aware of this issue.

“INTERNO C02FK99SMD6T” (serial code of my computer) aims to reflect on privacy in digital environments by focusing on trackers’ requests to access to others’ online data. Through an inter-semiotic translation process, textual accesses were converted into vocal requests using artificial intelligence. Imagined inside an intercom, the medium between our home and the outside world: the installation presents a scenario in which trackers, who have become noisy passers-by wish to gain access to our home, ringing the intercom in proportion to the accesses to our data.
