metaphor: >-
  The metaphor used for the infopoetry is the transposition of conversations and
  personal experiences of women into audio tracks in a CD, one per country.
  Giving voice to something that is generally silenced and guided by social and
  cultural constraints, the aim of the project is to deconstruct the taboo of
  female masturbation.
meaning: >-
  The metaphor tries to take on a double meaning:  the user identifies
  him/herself in the experiences of others like frequently happens with a song
  lyrics but at the same time should perceive masturbation as an everyday life
  practice, like listening to music.

“The Real Sound of Pleasure” is a sound installation regarding female masturbation. By listening to heterogeneous experiences of those who consider this gesture as a daily routine and something extremely natural, its main purpose is to break unhealthy stereotypes and unrealistic expectations.
