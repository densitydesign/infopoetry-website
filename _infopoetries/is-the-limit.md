metaphor: The "theft" of small pieces of skies a little at a time.
meaning: I wanted to simply highlight the human tendency of "touching the sky",
  which has developed incredibly in the last two centuries, but was already
  prominent since the very early stages of civilization.

This infopoem goal is to highlight the evolution of this phenomenon across human history, from 10.000 bc up to now, by visualizing the limit to which we push ourselves at "scraping" skies.
