  name: Personal stress level and calories consumption on my smartwatch, later
    converted into flammable plant material
metaphor: The final artifact will then be a stack of legal cannabis
  inflorescences, equal to the amount of needed to develop the same calories as
  the excess meals, it will be presented alongside a corresponding stack of food
  (e.g. if the excess calories over the time of a week are 100kcal a series of
  snacks whose caloric sum will give 100 will be placed on the table, of finaco
  a stack of 450 grams of hemp will be presented)
meaning: I wanted to emphasize the link between high stress levels and
  high-calorie food consumption, and the amount of energy that is assimilated
  due to stress.

The installation is a kitchen scale with on one plate the amount of high-calorie food I ate in a month, on the other plate the weight "corresponding to the calories" of cannabis, in a package that will explain the message and data with a camping stove to use the flammable material. The choice of using cannabis as a flammable plant material is related to the fact that I wanted to convey, as a secondary message, the short-circuiting of the use of such a drug, which in fact causes the so-called "munchies" that involves a reduction in stress level but an increase in food consumption.
