  This Website is designed to position the user in front of the roulette game
  and provoke the user to experience it as the gambler. Depending if the user is
  on the hot or cold streak, the game would act accordingly, making the gambler
  feel very content and confident or miserable and cornered. 
meaning: >-
  I believe that the user of this infopoetry will get a deep insight into the
  working of the average gambler’s mind, and hopefully be amazed and stunned by
  it. Moreover, I believe that it will also bring a big revelation of the games’
  influence on our minds and maybe even some self-reflection if the user was in
  a similar position before.
