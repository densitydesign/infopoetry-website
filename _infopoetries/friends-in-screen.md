metaphor: >-
  Apps are just like friends that you can meet only several hours per day. So we
  treasure these hours we spent together. 
meaning: >-
  Not only me, to all the users of these Apps. Call to cherish the time spent on
  the screen.

I have friends on the screen, how long do I spend with them? I cherish the time when we are together. In ios, there is a function that limits your time with a certain App, the icon turns dark when you spend too much on it, it's really a sad scene.
