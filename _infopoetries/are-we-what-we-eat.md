The contemporary world is experiencing a major
food emergency. The food we choose to eat, its production
chain and the ways and places in which we
consume it have a profound effect on the
mechanisms that govern our society and our times. The aim of the work is to show the current food system, which is based on an erroneous
perception of the value of food and of a short-sighted vision of how it should be produced
and consumed, has grown in a way that is unsustainable.
