metaphor: >-
  A surface showing the planisphere is pierced at the exact point of the
  meteoriteâ€™s impact. The dimension of the holes depends on the mass of the
  meteorite. A light is placed behind the pierced surface in a dark environment
  so that the holes can project light beams. 
meaning: >-
  The aim of the project is to recreate in the viewer the feeling that you feel
  when you see a shooting star, the charm and melancholy of the light projected
  from the fallen stars over the years.

Where do stars go after falling? For thousands of years, man was fascinated by the sight of a shooting star. The projections of light on the world map show the exact place where meteorites fell recreating a pattern similar to a starry sky on our planet.
