metaphor: >-
  The translation of the delay time into another form is done with the creation
  of a new unit of measure. It takes us on average about 2 minutes to read a
  page of a book, and that is where the process of converting time begins. We
  can then obtain data on the short term and data on the long term by
  extrapolation. The time obtained is then converted into paper pages.
meaning: >-
  The intention is to create a different image of the delay that starts from
  time but is measured with a new unit of measurement that corresponds to an
  action.

  Reading, which is the action chosen, is an activity common to many commuters
  and gives a tangible and physical dimension to an immaterial phenomenon
  because are the pages themselves with their materiality to give this size.

  The idea behind the infopoetry is to give the reader an image that is not as
  scientific as the delay in minutes, which usually results in negative
  emotions, but a more material one that can rise different reflections, but
  that still keeps within itself the starting information.

The installation depicts a board with the delays of some very busy Trenord's sections. Delay is rappresented by the action of reading,with a page for every 2 minutes of dealy, the average time to read it. The thickness of the pages  added one above the other gives a new perceptive dimension of time.
