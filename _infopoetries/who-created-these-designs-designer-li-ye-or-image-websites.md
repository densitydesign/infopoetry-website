  name: '"browsing preferences" data kept by Pinterest and Behance'
metaphor: |-
  1. Mirror: Because the final result wants to express the
  argument that recommendation algorithms influence
  personal aesthetics, I want to use a visual metaphor to
  guide the audience to observe and compare the output
  of "algorithmic recommendation data" and the output
  of "individuals", so I want to choose the classic visual
  metaphor as " mirror" with the meaning of "similarity"
  and "comparison".
  2. Find the Difference Game: also a classic visual form
  that leads to "juxtaposition" and "contrast".
meaning: Through the message poem, I wanted to express that the recommendation
  algorithm of image sites using personal data has an impact on the personal
  aesthetics of designers.

My information poetry installation consists of three juxtaposed sets of posters, each of which will be provided with a booklet explaining the process of producing this work. The viewer will first notice the posters juxtaposed in groups and then read the information on the posters to understand the style of the posters from a project and the visual references I found on photo sites to design the project. I wanted the audience to look at the similarities and differences between the two posters in each group in order to consider the questions posed by this information poem, "Who made these designs, the designer or the photo site?" and "Does the recommendation algorithm of the photo site using personal data have an impact on the designer's personal aesthetics?"
