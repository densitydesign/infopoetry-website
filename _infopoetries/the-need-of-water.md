metaphor: "The installation features a sink as a metaphoric symbol. Through
  indication lines on its inside, it turns into an interactive measuring cup
  making aware of wasting water. Additionally, the mirror above indicates the
  associated facts. While reading, the viewer reflects in the mirror as a
  trigger to self-evaluation. "
meaning: The goal of the project is to make viewers aware of their water
  consumption habits at the same time they are consuming water. In this way,
  viewers are confronted with an issue at the same time they could make a change
  about it.

Water is a valuable good, but in everyday life, we often forget how much of it we waste. This project aims as a reminder to rethink our water consumption habits. To make the problem tangible the installation is placed around a sink - a commonplace of irresponsible water waste.
