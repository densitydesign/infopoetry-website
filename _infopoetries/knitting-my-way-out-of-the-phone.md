  name: ScreenTime of the iPhone
metaphor: The form of time as a physical object represents how we can take
  control back of the hours we have wasted while hypnotised by screens
meaning: "The observers should reflect on their screen time and if that is used
  for useful purposes or if it can be used for something more meaningful. "

This infopoem is a knitted histogram of the screen time of my phone. I have always wanted to start knitting but I thought I had no time, here is a representation of how I was actually spending my time: in front of the screen. The artifact represents a more meaningful way to spend time. The different colours stand fot different activities done in that specific day (university, at home, exam days, in my hometown) and the small black knot indicates one hour of time.
