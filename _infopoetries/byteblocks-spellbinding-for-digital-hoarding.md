  name: "Two personal computer disks frequently used since 2018: more than 1600
    different kinds of files."
metaphor: The Scrabble game serves as an allegory for the process of bringing
  order to the chaotic landscape of digital possessions, where each letter tile
  corresponds to a digital file, and arranging these tiles into meaningful words
  represents the act of categorizing and organizing data. This metaphor
  highlights the significance of mindful arrangement and management of digital
  possessions for a more organized and purposeful digital existence. However,
  even if one doesn't organize the files, as long as it's balanced for you,
  every letter tiles or files can be meaningful on its own term.
meaning: The electronic objects sometimes carry the emotional attachments. A
  love- shaped cloud, pink and purple sunset, and even the same angle of
  thousands selfie in the photo album...... Despite seemingly mundane photos,
  when I look back I feel like a time thief, stealing a piece of the world the
  moment I pressed the shooting button. The reason for keeping all the
  ""pieces"" of information is that I don't want to erase the experiences that
  happened to me by deleting. This ""emotional storage"" satisfies inner needs,
  while ""instrumental storage"" offers a sense of security, storing unread
  books or tutorials. Better to have all of them rather than need them and not
  having them. Electronic hoarding reflects also the era of fragmented time,
  manifesting in dilemmas like pausing an article for transportation. In our era
  of information overload, storing knowledge delays processing, addressing
  knowledge anxiety.

The upcoming iteration of the “Scrabble game” within this project serves a distinct purpose: fostering mindfulness regarding digital habits. It simulates the process of organizing files by paralleling the arrangement of letters into words. All game elements —boards, letter tiles, and scoring books—are crafted according to the project’s dataset.
