  name: "Purchase history from the online shopping platform Taobao: more than
    1,000 shopping records from 2017 to the present."
metaphor: In my project, on the one hand, I use a collage to present individual
  items I have purchased, and the collage composite reflects the overall
  consumer portrait I have formed. This symbolizes the diversity of my personal
  shopping history and the unified perspective presented by the Al algorithm
  that integrates this information.On the other hand, I use the leaflet" as a
  metaphor to symbolize and express how Al influences and shapes our consumer
  behavior. This metaphor emphasizes the potential influence of algorithms on
  our choices by comparing the similarities between algorithmic recommendations
  and supermarket leaflets.
meaning: Today, human beings have been alienated into commodities under the
  pervasive gaze of algorithms also trapped in the Filter Bubble made of
  algorithms, the Filter Bubble is a critique of the capitalistic mechanism that
  makes human futures predictable and strips individuals of their autonomy. My
  project aims to provoke critical thought and inspire a reclaiming of personal
  agency in the narrative o the algorithmic and commercial world.

This project, through a collection of personal shopping data, reveals the invisible threads of algorithmic influence. Each leaflet juxtaposes past purchases against AI suggestions, portraying a narrative of calculated choices. The infopoem invites introspection on the autonomy of our desires in an era where our digital footprints are closely monitored and commodified. it’s a visual and reflective journey that questions the authenticity of our consumption choices, resonating with the subtle yet profound impact of technology on our everyday decisions. And let the audiences think about Just What Is It That Makes Digital Age’s us So Different, So Appealing.
