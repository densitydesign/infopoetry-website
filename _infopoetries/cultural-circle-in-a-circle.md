Taking as a basis the Italian cultural environment and its institutions, my work is inspired by Kandinsky,
one of the most original and influential artists of the twentieth-century, and the style of his abstract painting.
The dataset used concerns the museums, the archaeological sites and monuments in Italy and the source from which it was derived is the website istat.it
