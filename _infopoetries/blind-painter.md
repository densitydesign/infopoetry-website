  name: "Words and sentences I would use to talk about myself. Images produced by
    Dall_E. "
metaphor: "Imagine: you are posing for a portrait and the painter is blind.
  There is only one way to get your portrait: tell him about yourself. What do
  you choose to say when you talk about yourself?"
meaning: >-
  The project is a process of self-knowledge.

  In this case, however, the interlocutor is not another person but it’s a ‘blind’ and extraneous machine. The machine is not just a blind painter, it is a painter that has the knowledge of all the others painters within it. The resulting image is the synthesis of many others. A hermeneutic mechanism of knowledge and understanding of algorithmic language is therefore also involved in this process.

"Using Dall-E, an AI system that can create images from a description in natural language I wrote different prompts with the objective of obtaining an image similar to my real self.
Starting from writing my name and surname, I changed the prompt every time trying to get an output similar to my self-image. Every time I try different ways to describe me, looking at the physical aspect, the mood and the actions that I did that day. Obtaining a sort of algorithmic diary. 
Blind painter is a book that collects all these images and retrace my research process, a meticulous analysis of my self-image."
