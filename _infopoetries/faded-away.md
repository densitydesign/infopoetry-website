metaphor: >-
  Portraits similar to passport photos represent person identities: images are
  what define and construct the concept of person, its story, its background,
  its relationships, its actions. Subsequently, the flattening identities can be
  represented by material homogenization, the act of applying the same kind and
  amount of physical intervention on the actual photos.
meaning: >-
  The reader should emphatize with the phenomenon focusing on the visual
  identities of missing people and their ruined portaits. Moreover, the
  generalization and flattening of the semantic use of the term “Missing people”
  can raise debate, in order to question the habitual, what we usually don’t
  question and doesn’t seem to pose a problem.

S-parire (ex-pareo) doesn't mean just to disappear but also to disobey. Disobedience is translated into the escaping of a social role and subsequently into identity loss. In this way, missing people leave the social norm, they conform to anonymity, synthesized by the general use of the term “missing”.
