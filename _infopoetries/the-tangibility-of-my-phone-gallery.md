  name: Personal dataset of approximately 14,500 photos collected over five years
    from my smartphone.
metaphor: |-
  The folders in this project are like a metaphor. They
  represent how digital photos from our phones would look
  if they were real, physical photos. This helps us see and
  understand the impact of our digital photo collections.
meaning: |-
  This project aims to make this invisible digital
  waste visible and tangible, bring to the forefront
  the idea of digital wastage. Just because it’s not
  physically taking up space, it doesn’t mean it’s not
  there.

“The Tangibility of My Phone Gallery” is an
exhibit that transforms the intangible clutter
of digital photos into a physical reality. In this
project, I focus on 24 months out of a five-year
period, during which approximately 9,900
photos were collected on my smartphone. I use
empty folders or boxes (without real photos in
them). Each box shows a month from these two
years. The size of each box changes depending
on how many photos I took that month – more
photos mean a thicker box. Every box has a label
showing the year, the month, and how many
photos it represents.
