Brainwaves was discovered In 1924 by Dr Hans Berger, using an early EEG (electroencephalograph) to monitor electrical activity in the brain. Neural oscillation are generated by the activity of the brain. Like any electrical emission, the intensity of brain waves is measured in hertz. We can produce different kind of brain waves depending on different need and moments.
