The carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas which is naturally in the atmosphere, and it’s environmental effects are of particular interest. CO2 is a primary source of life on Earth since it’s a key element for the photosynthesize carbohydrate, but after the industrial revolution, its concentration increased rapidly leading to global warming and to ocean acidification. In these last years, everyone must have heard about carbon dioxide and the need to limit its production. This visualization is meant to give a different perspective on this phenomenon and a better awareness of the problem. What would happen if everyone on the planet polluted like a Chinese? How will the CO2 emissions change? Will it increase? How about Italians? Americans? Finnish?
