metaphor: >-
  The evocative image used to represent the level of people’s happiness is the
  smile. Since the topic is related to people’s emotions, pictures of their
  facial expressions are used to show the different levels of happiness. When
  the value changes, the intensity of their smiles increases or decreases.
meaning: >-
  Since motor mimicry is one of the means by which we infect each other with our
  feelings, the images of real people’s smiles can pass on their emotion to the
  observers and help them empathize with the data so to experience it not only
  visually, but also emotionally and in a more personal way.
