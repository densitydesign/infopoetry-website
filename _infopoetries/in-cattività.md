  name: Based on my gallery of photographs taken from 2016 to 2022, I put together
    a collection of over 180 images depicting different animals I have seen or
    interacted with
metaphor: In Cattività was created to make the transition from the animal world
  to the digital world explicit through a simple touch on the screen.
meaning: "It is meant to be a game that demonstrates how and with which animals
  we come into contact in everyday life "
