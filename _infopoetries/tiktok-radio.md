  playing songs in the same way we listen to them on TikTok (stripped of the
  visual part), the intent of the

  infopoem is to make people aware that using TikTok is also a way of listening to music, and that probably it’s not the best way to appreciate it.

On TikTok, we are not just consuming videos; actually, the most popular type of content on
these platforms consists of using 15-second-orshorter clips of a song as background music for any sort of video. While scrolling on our phones, we’re actually consuming music. This kind of listening is partial, fragmented, and repetitive. On TikTok, songs have been reduced to mere seconds, making the rest of the lyrics seem irrelevant or unimportant. By using radio the intent of the infopoem is to make people aware that using TikTok is also a way of listening to music, and that probably it’s not the best way to appreciate it.
