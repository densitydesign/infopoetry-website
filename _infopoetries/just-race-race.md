metaphor: >-
  The metaphor of the time spent going from home to work (based on the area and
  the percentual of black and brown people) is playing the maze and choosing one
  of the 3 starting points, performing different complexities to reach the
  center of the game (work place).
meaning: >-
  I intend to provoke in people empathy and self-questioning of meritocracy. The
  game allows the spectator to perform different realities through different
  starting points and make evident the connection between these differences, the
  skin tone and the literal geographic marginalization of the black and brown
  population. I want to give visibility to the sad reality of Brasil’s heritage
  of slavery: the institucional racism.

In São Paulo, Brazil, the average time spent in traffic from home to work, and back, is almost two hours a day. In peripheral areas of the city, where the majority of the population is brown and black, people spend from four up to fifteen hours a day. Play Just Race Race to perform those realities.
