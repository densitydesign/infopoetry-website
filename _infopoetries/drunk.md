metaphor: >-
  In this project, a bottle of Chinese spirits appears in the video screen. With
  the decrease of alcohol, the video screen becomes more and more blurred, and
  even double shadows appear, just like drunk people, with the increase of body
  alcohol concentration, their eyes are gradually blurred.
meaning: >-
  In China, alcohol consumption is increasing faster than anywhere else in the
  world. 

  A steady increase in alcohol production has also been observed in the country,
  together with a rise in alcohol-related harm.Many people die of alcohol
  poisoning every year.

  I would like to show the chaos when people drink too much and some terrible
  data to remind people not to drink too much alcohol.
