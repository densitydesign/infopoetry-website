  name: "The selected data refer to my experience and my personal life in terms of
    spaces where I have been living in the last years, including habits and
    communications with friends and relatives. In particular, the dataset
    contains data gathered on: a. Google Maps, through which I have traces my
    movements in time; b. WhatsApp, on which all my text messages are available
    since 2016; (c.) Personal hard disk, containing images and videos stored in
    these years."
metaphor: The most straightforward metaphor to express this project has turned
  out to be that of a similar-Atlas diary. In the past, to keep track of this
  type of data, it was necessary to write journals that had an inherently
  miscellaneous nature due to the variety of content (collages, annotations,
  etc.). Similarly, here, where the data from one platform is insufficient to
  tell the story of a certain period, the data from another platform is. This
  has allowed me to reconstruct my past in its most straightforward and everyday
  aspects.
meaning: The reflection from which this work arises is that if it weren't for
  the presence of some digital platforms, my ability to remember past habits,
  spaces, people, and relationships would be significantly less. The
  communication objective, therefore, is to expose this experience and make the
  user empathize with my discovery of my past through simple and everyday
  elements, which become just an example of something universal.

A brief inquiry on my digital traces is as a brief visual and verbal essay on the traces I have left in my past and rediscovered through algorithmic tools. The diary presents a mixture of materials, that follow the miscellaneous nature of the disconnected memories we have of our past, but that at the same time result to be so important and vital.
