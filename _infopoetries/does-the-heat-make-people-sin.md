metaphor: >-
  I want to use heating (focusing with a magnifier by sunlight) on my medium
  (cloth). 
meaning: >-
  As time goes on, the focus point temperature will rise, and more burned marks
  will appear, thereby symbolizing that a rise in temperature will increase the
  crime rate.

The temperature comes from the natural environment, that is, the sun. There are many types of crime. As a result, a victim may be "injured or caused damage." The burned object symbolizes the victim with cloth and clothing.
