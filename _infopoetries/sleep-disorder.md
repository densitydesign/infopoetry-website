  name: The data comes from my smart watch app records and my diary in the notebook.
metaphor: I chose the case file as a carrier to record my physical and
  psychological conditions as well as the various pressures I experienced over
  the past two weeks. Expressing sleep disorder in a morbid form allows the
  audience to visually see my situation and reflect on the stress caused by
  modern society.
meaning: Nowadays, the diversified and rapid development of modern society has
  put forward higher adaptability requirements for people. The fierce
  competition and fast-paced social life have brought huge psychological
  pressure to people. This current research status is incompatible with the
  current high-tempo, high-competition, high-tension, and high-pressure real
  social life in our country. The project aims to delve into the psychological
  level and reveal the factors that affect sleep, thereby attracting social
  attention and encouraging people to consciously relax themselves.

The fierce competition and fast-paced social life have brought huge psychological pressure. Sleep disorder is about exploring the relationship between my daily experiences and sleep. Explore the impact of emotions, mood, stress, etc. on us from a deep level, mainly focusing on family, study, work, social culture, disease and other dimensions, thereby attracting social attention and encouraging people to relax themselves. I chose case files as a carrier to record my physical and mental conditions as well as the various pressures I suffered over the past two weeks, so as to allow the audience to reflect on the pressure brought by modern society.
