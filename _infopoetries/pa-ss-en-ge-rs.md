metaphor: >-
  Starting from the concept of improper accessibility, the info poetry thinks
  about the issue of personal data and on the unaware life that these have
  outside of our control. The installation consists of a self-made machine
  capable of collecting such data in an improper way, collecting them without
  the owners' awareness. In fact, the devices release these data unknowingly.
  The installation returns them by printing the identification codes of the
  mobile devices. The installation also reasons on the concept of failure: our
  devices are constantly accessing networks that they do not have access to. 
meaning: >-
  The technology we thought we were using to make life more efficient started
  using us some time ago. It is now attempting to reshape our social behaviour
  into patterns reminiscent of the total surveillance culture. We risk allowing
  ourselves to become a vast network of informants on each other and ourselves.
  The idea behind infopetry is to reflect on the loss of control of our data.

People constantly pass through spaces, but what remains? PA:SS:EN:GE:RS is a device that allows creating a virtual crowd by storing signals from everyone around, making them persistent and visible. They might have left us physically, but their virtual presence will stay with us.
