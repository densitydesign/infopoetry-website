World Health Organization (WHO) data speaks of a world inhabited by medically obese people. People with Body Mass Index (BMI), the measure of relative size based on the mass and height of an individual, greater than or equal to 30 (a condition that defines obesity) are spread all around the world, although in different percentage. The aim of this project is to visualize the different presence of overweight people in the world, bringing out directly differences among WHO regions by their thickness.
