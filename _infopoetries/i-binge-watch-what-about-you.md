  name: 'Statista: Binge viewing  habits in the United States in 2017, by age.'
metaphor: >-
  The metaphor that is used is two boxes of popcorn each representing the types
  of binge-watching which are the heavy (binge daily) and light (binge less than
  once a month), using different corn types (real corn to burnt popcorn) to show
  the age difference in the box which is shown by a transparent cut in the
  middle of the box.
meaning: >-
  The main reason is to show and make people aware that age is not a main reason
  of binge watching, and that the majority of ages binge with almost the same
  percentage. The percentage who binge on a daily base is really high and this
  is a social addiction habit that is affecting everyone.

Binge-watching is a habit that is affecting almost all ages, itâ€™s a way to escape from real life to live the life shown in movies and series continuously without stopping. A majority of people watch continiuosly not knowing that they are getting addicted to the act of binge-watching.
