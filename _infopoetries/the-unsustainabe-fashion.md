metaphor: >-
  The GHG emissions of the fashion industries were categorised and represented
  by different fabrics. Meanwhile, the value of each category was represented by
  the size, cut and sewed into a single complete garment. The installation is
  structured as a visual merchandising in the store, to raise the consciousness
  of sustainable shopping habits to the audience.
meaning: >-
  The installation demonstrates the massive influence of fashion  to climate
  change in an intelligible way, with the design of visual merchandising
  language that is commonly used in commerce, which aims to appeal the audiences
  to make conscious efforts to act sustainably on their daily practice of
  shopping.
