metaphor: >-
  The main function of prison is rehabilitative, which is why prisoners'
  detention conditions are regulated by the European Court of Human Rights. The
  idea is to create cages through a metal grid in which to insert objects to
  give the feeling of detention and at the same time of overcrowding. The
  objects are inserted proportionally to the level of cell occupancy for each
  region. Where occupation exceeds one hundred percent it is difficult to read
  the shape of the different objects and to distinguish them, because their
  nature itself is distorted. The size of the cage is proportional to the
  maximum capacity of the region (the larger the cage the more detainees is able
  to host). There is a privileged point to observe the installation around which
  an area of three square meters will be traced.
meaning: >-
  The will is to transmit the degrading condition of prisons through the
  claustrophobic and overcrowded representation of the cells. At the same time
  the installation represents the inhumane condition to which prisoners are
  subjected when the minimum holding spaces are not respected.

The function of prison is rehabilitative, which is why prisoners' detention conditions are regulated by the European Court of Human Rights. Every prisoner should have three square meters. Despite this, the Italian prisons today are in a condition of constant overcrowding making inhuman the detention.
