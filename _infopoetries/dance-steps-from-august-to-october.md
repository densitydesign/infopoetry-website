  name: "Journey step data over three months, in five main parts: date, grade,
    number of steps, location and direction."
metaphor: When talking about walking, we usually involve the number of steps and
  direction, and arrows would be the most suitable metaphor to express. Arrows
  are made up of size, direction and color, which correspond to the number of
  steps, direction and level.
meaning: Our daily actions are represented physically, and we rarely review them
  from a macro perspective. Recording the way we walk every day is like a diary,
  which can make us deeply feel the vivid life trajectory. We tend to be
  skeptical about access and tracking on mobile apps, but there is no denying
  that they are also silently recording data for us to recall, which is a very
  small but very warm function.

The months of August, September and October 2023 were very important to me, because it was the first time I went alone to other countries to study. So I want to use my phone’s positioning and tracking technology to record my tracks. These tracks make up a map like the steps of a dance, so that I can remember life’s important journeys and memories. The purpose is to explore how people can use the intrusion of access to shape a new way of living in the irreversible information age.
