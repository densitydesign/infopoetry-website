  The metaphor is a video showing how the abuse of Adderall increased over the
  years. This data will be metaphorically represented by a number of pills
  proportional to the number of people. The pills will be red to represent the
  danger of abusing this prescription stimulants. In the background, speeches
  about people experience of addiction and abuse of Aderrall will be reproduced.
meaning: >-
  Taken as prescribed, Adderall improves concentration and leads to better
  performance at work and at school. But as we live in a knowledge economy
  world, the need for long periods of concentration increases with
  competitiveness, so students often abuse it. Although they feel immune to the
  side effects they are instead sensitive to the dangers. The effect I want to
  provoke is to let people understand Adderall doesn't make you smarter, it do
  not give your brain superpowers, it just makes you addicted.
