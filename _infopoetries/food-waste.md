metaphor: >-
  The first thing that impressed me was the incredible amount of food we waste
  every year per capita in Italy (149 kg/year), which roughly means throwing
  away 0,4 kg of food every day as an estimate. I was really shocked by these
  numbers, but at the same time, I was asking myself: what does 149 kg mean? How
  can I actually feel it? Suddenly a question came to my mind and triggered all
  the translation process: what is the weight of my actions? I imagined creating
  365 packets, as the days in a year, each of them with a weight of 0,4 kg,
  which when added together give the total amount of wasted food in Italy per
  capita in a year.

  The aim of my infopoetry is to impress the user, to provoke an emotional
  reaction of dismay, to make the user feel the gravity of the issue and the
  physical weight of his/her everyday actions. What I hope, though, is not only
  to provoke sadness or concern, but Iâ€™d like the user to question
  himself/herself; my desire is to encourage him/her to personally take action
  and act in a better and more responsible way.

When we throw food away we treat it as a worthless stone. The infopoetry shows the environmental impacts of wasted food. It consists of 365 packets, each filled with stones with a weight of 0,4 kg, which when added together give the total amount of wasted food in Italy per capita in a year (149 kg).
