When we throw food away we treat it as a worthless stone. The infopoetry shows the environmental impacts of wasted food. It consists of 365 packets, each filled with stones with a weight of 0,4 kg, which when added together give the total amount of wasted food in Italy per capita in a year (149 kg).
