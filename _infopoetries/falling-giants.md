The model shows the number of cultural heritage in danger over the last 18 years: the dataset has been selected because the phenomenon is growing, and itâ€™s necessary to understand it. The structure has two dimensions, accessible thanks to the rotation of a handle: the first one shows a ruined archaeological site; the second one, raising the columns, allows the comparison between the heights and therefore the comprehension of the data. The visualization is designed in order to accentuate the concept of destruction, which is taking away these ancient monuments while paying attention to remembering that a considerable percentage of this is due to human activities.
