  name: "I tracked the time I spend on Instagram and what activities I do in the
    app: viewing and liking a post or a video, receiving and sending messages,
    posting stories, typing in the search bar."
metaphor: "Sonic loop: sound as signal and the loop to depict the repetitiveness
  of my unconscious scrolling"
meaning: I spend too many hours of the day on Instagram without even realizing
  it. So the aim of the project is to capture attention in an almost hypnotic
  way to recall the effect Instagram produces on my mind and to give a measure
  of all the time wasted in endless scrolling.

This is a chronicle of my activities on Instagram over 3 days. The aim is to give these gestures a new substance to show their recurrence. The dataset was translated into a visual and sonic loop. This is meant to imitate social media: they are quite mesmerizing, providing endless entertainment.
