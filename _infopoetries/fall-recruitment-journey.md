  name: Collection of my participation in the recruitment of Chinese Internet
    companies
metaphor: >-
  During this process, I have been very anxious and nervous. Almost all
  companies involved in autumn recruitment will require applicants to take a
  comprehensive test without major classification after the they submit their CV
  and portfolio, the test is including graphic and logical reasoning, data
  analysis, personality tests, etc.And then are the first interview, major based
  test, second interview, second major based test and so on...


  Looking back now, I feel that rough and hard twine can best describe the state of mind at that time, I try to follow the way that most of people would choose, I belong to a member of 10.76 million Chinese graduates, just like one of the thousands of fibers that make up hemp rope, I intend to use twine to represent the timeline, different colors/brightness of twine ball represent different companies, and different sizes represent different application state.
meaning: Through my recruitment story, I want to tell that the competition is
  fierce and the process is suffering it's important to find our own way and
  make preparations to raise our competitiveness before blindly entering the job
  market.

In the post-epidemic era, college students show low employment confidence, anxiety, and confusion about personal development. The purpose of this project is to present a real process of applying for Chinese autumn recruitment and explore what we can do to be more confident and prepared for employment.
