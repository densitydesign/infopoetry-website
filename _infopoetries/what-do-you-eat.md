metaphor: The candy is metaphor for all the harmful compounds inside food.
meaning: It may have happened to many of us that we have lost our loved ones due
  to cancer or other diseases. In the face of many diseases, we may not be able
  to do anything. However, in some of them, we can, such as avoiding eating
  foods that contain carcinogens. Additionally, healthy eating is challenging in
  the fast-paced digital age. We generally think that if we eat less fast food,
  we have a more healthy diet. But the reality of having a healthy diet is much
  more complicated. Most of the things we consider healthy contain
  preservatives, palm oil, etc., which affect our health in the long run, and we
  should be very aware.

The poster is a candy which is metaphor for all the harmful compounds inside food items I have eaten in the last two years. And a book that shows more details about every food and its harmful parts separately.
