  The mirror is the material that most manages to render the superficial image
  just as breast cancer is, among all cancers, the one that most touches the
  external appearance of the woman. Each fragment of a mirror represents those
  women whose lives are suddenly broken.
meaning: >-
  Showing Psychological aspects of women with breast cancer: how they live the
  disease and the mastectomy. How many of these women have the hope of
  surviving. Furthermore, the installation is intended to be an awareness of the
  increase of the psycho-oncologist, who supports these women at all stages of
  the disease.

In Italy, breast cancer affects one woman in nine throughout their lives, with 52,800 new diagnoses only in 2018. 70% of these women develop a metastatic tumour diagnosis. Every mirror fragment of this installation tells the emotional and heartbreaking side of the disease.
