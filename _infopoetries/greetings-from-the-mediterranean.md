metaphor: Every postcard represent 50 migrants who died or went missing while
  trying to cross the Mediterranean sea from Northern Africa to Southern Italy
  between 2015 and 2021.
meaning: "My fascination with this idea started with a reflection on the places
  where these tragedies happen: the sea. I was struck by the contrast between
  what is usually our imaginary about the sea and the seaside, and the tragic
  events that happen just a few miles off of our shores. With this project I
  wanted to emphasize this divergence by combining the two aspects, linking them
  together to provide a new perspective on the topic."

I chose a a series of postcard as a metaphor to convey the number of migrants who died while crossing the Mediterranean from Africa to Italy. The postcards are organized by the incident to which they refer. They feature photos of the open sea on the front, along with text containing the coordinates of the incident site, which can be viewed on Google Maps by scanning the QR code on the back. The design of the postcards (colors, font choices, layout) is inspired by the stereotypical look and aesthetic of Italian seaside postcards.
