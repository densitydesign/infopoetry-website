The organic of the band "G. Verdi " of Capolago, in Varese. Each musician is represented by a note: the duration of the note is the age of the musician (eg quarter note = 20 years); the height of the note represents the instrument played by the musician (the instruments are sorted from most acute to most severe); the color of the note is the gender of the musician (red if female, blue if male). The layout of the musicians reflects the positions used during rehearsals and concerts.
