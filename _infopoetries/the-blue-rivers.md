  I want to use the blue water to represent textile industrial wastewater
  because jeans are one of the most serious and visible examples. The amount of
  blue water related to the more consumption of water. The action ‘screwing’ is
  compared to the process of the discharge of pollutants. The blue traces after
  water flew past will represent some rivers in China, which is polluted by
  textile industrial wastewater. The blue stains on the bare feet mean the toxic
  chemicals in the wastewater will damage our health.

  In this info-poetry, I want to show the horrendous data in more artistic and
  visible ways and involve people attach importance to the existing problem. It
  will be great if the viewers start to introspect themselves and change to
  choose a more environmentally friendly and sustainable lifestyle.
