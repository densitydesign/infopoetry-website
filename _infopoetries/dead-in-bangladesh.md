A poster to reflect upon the garment supply chain and the respect for workers, which highlights the label. A project to reveal what is hidden behind garment production, as the number of people dead between 2010 and 2013 in Bangladeshi garment factories, in addition to the number of accidents that every year inevitably strike the employees of this small State, which bases its economy on clothes production.
