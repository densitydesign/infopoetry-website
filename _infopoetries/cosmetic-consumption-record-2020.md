  name: Spending records on cosmetic consumption platforms in 2020. Name, time,
    category and volume of the cosmetic products purchased.
metaphor: A dot on the poster symbolises the daily consumption of a cosmetic
  product; the total number of dots symbolises the number of days it will take
  for the bottle to be consumed. The posters are divided into columns according
  to the function of the cosmetics. Cosmetics with the same function will be
  accumulated in one column. For example, a 30ml bottle of make-up lasts 60
  days, while five 30ml bottles of foundation were purchased in 2020. There will
  be 300 points on the poster in the primer category."
meaning: By linking cosmetic volumes and usage times and accumulating them over
  the same categories, one can get a more intuitive sense of the relationship
  between cosmetic purchase rates and usage rates. Over-consumption results in
  the hoarding of cosmetics.

How much make-up do we buy in a year? How long does it take us to use up all that make-up? Why do we stock up on so many products when we can use just a few dots of cosmetics on a poster every day, and why do we want to keep buying new ones? Is it commercial promotion behind the booming beauty culture and cosmetics market? Appearance anxiety? Or is it consumerism? It's worth reflecting on.
