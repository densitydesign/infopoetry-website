metaphor: >-
  The idea behind the project is to use plastic waste materials in a delimited
  space to represent the current situation about the amount of plastic present
  in our oceans. The intention is to recreate a setting in which the water is
  represented by a transparent material, trying to simulate a stretch of water.
  This cubic space is filled by everyday usage of plastic items. The recreation
  of this unusual transposition of habitat wants to make the user live an
  immersive experience difficult to set any other way. 
meaning: >-
  The use of plastic waste materials wants to evoke a direct link to a critical
  situation and our everyday behaviours. The metaphor wants to make the user
  think about the issue making him/her face the effective dimensions of the
  problem but thatâ€™s an amount almost impossible to imagine. The project wants
  to make evident the fact that the situation is already gone too far, we are
  killing our oceans by pollution.
