metaphor: The morphed video acts as a visual metaphor that highlights the gap
  between what is definible and what is not.
meaning: Algorithms pretend to know us simply through the analysis of our
  actions on certain social medias, without knowing the real intentions behind
  them, therefore this installation aims at making this discrepancy visible by
  morphing what the algorithm thinks we are into what we really are (an
  indefinible and abstract mass of thoughts and images).

“Morph Me” has at its core the aim to expose the gap between algorithmic assumptions and our
true identity. The visual metaphor, a morphed video using AI in Touch Designer, signifies the disparity between definable and abstract. The dataset’s focus on images, converted into new
images, highlights the fallacy of algorithmic understanding. “Morph me” is an exploration of our digital identity in an algorithm-dominated world.
