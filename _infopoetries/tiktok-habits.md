  name: A record of the TikTok video watched (2022- 2023), with the content of the
    video messages organized and categorized.
metaphor: I represent myself by using a bin to categorise the short videos I
  watch using four types of bins. Bins filled with rubbish is like how I felt
  after watching the short video, my brain was filled with rubbish.
meaning: I think big data will always recommend things that match our viewing
  habits, which are more about stimulating the senses without actually being
  relevant. Time will pass in this process, so I want to categorise this
  content, so that viewers can review their own usage habits through my video
  content, as well as the content of the video information, and then control
  their own usage time, so that they can quickly find out and jump out of the
  information cocoon or shorten their own usage time when receiving a lot of
  useless, repetitive information.

It always feels like time passes quickly when I use short video apps, and these fragmented messages always take up my time without me realizing it. But in the process I always don’t know what I got and can’t recall what I saw. So I started to review my short video records and when I saw them again I found them very boring and even with a lot of misinformation, most of the short videos I watched turned out to be rubbish in my eyes. I categorized these videos into rubbish and presented them.
