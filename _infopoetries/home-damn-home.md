metaphor: The metaphor consists of turning the doormat. from an object that is
  put in front of the door of the house to welcome people to an object that is
  no longer welcoming but prickly and that pushes people away. For this project
  I was inspired by the Dada approach of changing the original meaning of an
  ordinary object to provoke viewers and bring them to reflection. For the
  aesthetic part, the main references were instead the punk culture and the
  spiky platforms that Super Mario must overcome in Bowser’s castle.
meaning: >-
  "Finding a house for a university student is very difficult, because the
  budget is often limited and it is difficult to support expenses with odd jobs
  without depending on parents. Analysing the dataset we can see that there was
  a slight decrease in rents during the months of the pandemic, but this was
  temporary. I have chosen to show only the current situation, thus narrowing
  the timeline of the research, as there has not been a significant change in
  the situation in recent years. My aim is to provoke and induce the

  public to reflect."

My project is about the difficulty of finding affordable flats in Milan for universitary students and it's based on rents prices in Milan. It consists in a doormat, on which is drawn the map of Milan through 277 studs, that are different in heights and colours according to three different clusters.
