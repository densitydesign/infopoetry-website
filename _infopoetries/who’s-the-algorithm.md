  name: Google Calendar events, filtered for things that happened between 2019 and
    2023. It features more than 2000 unique events and 600 reoccurring ones,
    each characterised by ID, length and title.
metaphor: By visualising the concept in the form of a corrupted and broken
  screen (something that we usually see and pass by in public spaces), we can
  stimulate the reflection from the user.
meaning: >-
  In my vision, we are very little aware of the consequences that the dependency
  of digital tools and devices has on us. We can’t really see it unless
  something breaks our tranquillity.

  But do we have alternatives? The intention of the exhibition is to highlight the dystopia side of this common experience, by looking at it from a different point of view.

“Who’s the Algorithm?” I want to highlight how close we are getting to becoming algorithms just by using common digital tools such as Google Calendar. Nowadays, the dichotomy between humans and machines is something we don’t really pay attention to. By showing my personal experience, I want the user to perceive how digital tools can be a controversial way of dehumanisation.
