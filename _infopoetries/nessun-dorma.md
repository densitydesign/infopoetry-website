  name: "The number of alarms that I have collected on my phone from January to
    December 2022: 331 in total."
metaphor: A giant sequence of alarms and the sounds that define them.
meaning: "Make the user experience the main consequences of sleep deprivation:
  annoyance, anxiety, nervousness - states of mind that the installation
  attempts to emulate through the large size of the poster, the many times and
  colours, the alarm clocks transformed into graphic and sound elements."

The sequence of 331 alarms rang on my phone during the year 2022, repeated over and over again every day. This infopoem is about obsessive-compulsive disorder. The alarm clocks are classified according to the sound they emit to form a huge sound poster accompanied by the noise of the alarms produced by the Mp3.
