Due to deforestation Indonesia has literally changed its territory, losing 51.3% of the forest area within 65 years. A huge impact considering that in 1950 the forest cover land was 87% of the entire territory. It has been chosen to humanize the territory in order to create empathy and to make the audience see deforestation through the woman's breath and the changes of the her skin/forest.
