The InfoPoetry realized is based on the dataset containing the average level of literacy of each country. We chose to represent the data through a book, so as to create a unique artifact symbol that unites the identity of each country.
It is divided into 5 chapters, one for each continent and each page represents a single country. The single page contains an excerpt from the main literary work of the most representative writer of the nation.
The possibility to read the literary passage wants to represent more generally the free access to the culture and the awareness of it. The text, however, will be progressively deleted in each line, including the name of the author and the work, in proportion to the literacy rate: the greater the number of people unable to read and write, the greater the amount of text deleted.
