  "Mammoni" is commonly associated with choosy and lazy youngsters, but is it
  really like that? In reality, the economic situation prevents them from
  leaving. The barricaded windows are a metaphor for the imprisonment the
  adolescents suffer, their height, in relation to the total window height,
  shows the percentage of youngsters who are still living with their parents.
meaning: >-
  Showing the percentace of youngsters living in parent houses with walls on
  windows is a strong way to convey the idea of "imprisonment". The wall height
  is proportional to the percentage, and Italy has the most high walls. This, in
  comparison with other countries, could give a different point of view about
  "mammoni".

Compared to the EU, Italian youth lives with their parents even up to the age of 34. The phenomenon is part of the culture and Italians have their own word for it: “mammoni”. Lots of them want to set-up their life, but they cannot due to the particular social and economic situation.
