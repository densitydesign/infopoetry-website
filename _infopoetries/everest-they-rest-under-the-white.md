metaphor: |-
  Wax is a material very particular, it can be
  used to evocate some shapes and colors.
  The installation wants to evoke a mountain
  scenery and a freezing process taking examples
  from ice stalactites and snow.
  To do this process I decided to use wax to
  create the aggregations and a sheet of
  plexiglass to represent the mountain covered.
meaning: >-
  The goal of this static installation is to create a sort of contemplation for
  a structure that

  recalls the drama of mountaineering. There is something fascinating (the
  candor, the elegance of the

  forms) but in reality it is a dramatic scene: lovers of the rocks that have
  remained there where they

  have brought their pass. We want to reflect on immobility and on the respect
  for them.

No one knows exactly how many bodies remain on Mount Everest today, but there are more than 200. Climbers and Sherpas lie tucked into crevasses, buried under avalanche snow and exposed on catchment basin slopes. Most are concealed from view, but some are visible on the route to Everestâ€™s summit.
