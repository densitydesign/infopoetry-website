metaphor: The metaphor in use is the flag and the tapestry. The concept of the
  flag represents an emblem of a nationality, it is something powerful and
  recognisable. In this case, it is a signifying device that contains a series
  of flags within one. The tapestry on the other side is a product of entangled
  threads that makes only sense when it is put together. Through the small
  “mistakes” that it will contain, the tapestry will metaphorically point out
  the glitches of the assumptions.
meaning: My aim with the project is to stress the facets and possibilities of
  misinterpretation of the AI and depict its speculation in a slightly glitched
  way, where the resulting physical product of cultural assumptions will not be
  entirely flawless, yet it will be comprehensible.

My project begins with a reflection of my cultural background, which is a mixed and complex
matter. I wanted to leave the analysis to the language processing AI Chat-GPT, and see
if it could make assumptions about the countries I have a connection to, based on my search
history. The results were for the main part very close to what is true. For instance, it
understood my bicultural background of Italian and Austrian roots, my strong interest
for Japan, my translations from English to other languages etc.
