metaphor: >-
  The cutting of the height of newspapers and books represents the corresponding
  cut of sales. The sequence of “mutilated” artifacts forms a sort of physical
  histogram realized with the cutted physical artifacts: the height of the book
  is directly proportional to the sales trend of the data collected.
meaning: >-
  This infopoetry is aimed at emphasizing the decline in sales of copies of
  newspapers and books from 2011 to 2012. This can be associated with the advent
  of smartphones; as a result, the infopoetry is a complaint against the
  excessive abuse of them and the gradual abandonment of the analog.
