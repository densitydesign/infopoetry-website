metaphor: >-
  People who can’t sleep peacefully or with any other kind of sleep disorder,
  use to move and stress their pillows trying to fall asleep. In the metaphor
  “Insomnia”, every pillow, according to the different amount of folds,
  represents the percentage of population affected by insomnia. The more people
  suffer from a sleep disorder, the more the light will create high contrasts to
  emphasize the image ‘drama’. By the other hand, European populations with a
  lower level of insomnia are defined by a softer light that allows seeing
  unstressed pillows.
meaning: >-
  The metaphor has the target to highlight the importance of an action that
  often goes unnoticed. People use to think about the time that they spend
  awake, but with this infopoetry, I would like to give importance also to the
  time in which we should be able to dream and reach new energies because it is
  the time that we can’t see but that has significant importance too. Insomnia
  can create physical and psychological disorders that can influence our daily
  life, so I would like to focus on this topic to give it the right value and to
  let people think and reflect on it.

We use to value our daily activities, but what about sleep time quality? The sleep disorder can slowly disrupt a person's daily life, causing many physical and psychological disorders. In "Insomnia", restless pillows represent the increasing troubled condition of European populations.
