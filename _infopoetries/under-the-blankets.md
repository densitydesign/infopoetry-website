metaphor: >-
  The blanket can be considered the metonymy of homeless people. I have
  therefore decided to knit a treemap blanket, in which the different portions
  of cloth indicate the percentages previously reported. Then I will make the
  blanket dirty in proportion to the amount of time that a certain percentage of
  homeless have passed on the streets. 
meaning: >-
  The effect I want to provoke is a reflection that people, looking at the work
  in its materiality, can have on the deep meaning of the data represented on a
  recognizable and meaningful medium. We all relate to the blanket every day,
  but for some people, it is often the only object that accompanies them
  constantly. I would like the observer of the work to develop a new awareness
  about the topic, trying to give everything less for granted.

What remains when all is lost? Under the blankets tells the story of seven different homeless — in Italy 43.595 — forced to live in degraded and painful conditions. The higher the degree of dirt on their blanket, almost synonymous with home,
the longer they have spent time living on the street.
