  name: A week of personal WhatsApp conversations with girl friends, partner and
    parents, capturing the intricacies of safety-related check-in messages
    exchanged.
metaphor: >-
  Like the heartbeat, check-in messages have a distinctive pulsating rhythm. The
  heart rate monitor causes constant concern.

  Each message becomes a distinguishable heartbeat with its own nature, capturing tension pauses and safety confirmations' relief.
meaning: This routine communication is not a mere digital formality but a
  symptom of deeper issues. Cities are hostile for women, we live in constant
  fear for us and our girl friends to get home safe. The design communication is
  intended to convey the anxiety implicit in waiting. The intent is for viewers
  to perceive the buildup of tension in these visual representations and to
  portray the complexity and emotional charge that accumulates over time in
  these communications, inviting reflection on the social conditions that have
  made them an integral part of women's daily experience.
