metaphor: >-
  The increasing complexity of urban areas over the time that results from the
  rising of the urban population is represented by simulating a Chladni plate
  and a Tone generator. The Hertz will change accordingly to the percentage of
  the urban population. From random displays, the sand will take the form of
  different geometrical patterns.
meaning: >-
  I do not want to concern the user but to make him conscious of the future of
  urbanization. Also, the infopoetry is meant to make people rethink their idea
  of City as a complex problem.
