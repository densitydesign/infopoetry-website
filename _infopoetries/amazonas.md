metaphor: >-
  In this metaphor the diversity is compared in the characteristics of the
  dolphins in the world with a brand of pencils of colours called Dolphins, in
  whose set Premiere there are 36 different colours which refer to the
  subspecies that compose this family of the animal kingdom and the name of the
  color corresponds to the common name of every subspecies, presenting those who
  live in the sea as a majority (tonalities of dark blue) and on the other hand
  the species that they live in rivers as a minority (tonalities of light blue)
  being only 8 pencils, which characteristics make them clearly different, and
  of among which is outlined especially rose, that evidently does not belong to
  the general range of colours referring to the unique subspecies that possesses
  really this colour and lives principally in the waters of the most turbulent
  river in the world, The Amazonas. Hereby it is possible to understand his
  rarety and "exclusivity" allowing to see how the general characteristics of
  the others turn into a stereotype that makes it unique on the planet. 
meaning: >-
  The intentionality of this infopoetry is first of all break the stereotype
  that dolphins are only sea water animals and secondly, it is to highlight the
  Pink Dolphin species (Inia geoffrensis) which is practically an unknown and a
  unique creature in the world for its colour that only inhabits mainly in
  Colombian territory specifically in the Amazon river.

The waters of The Amazonas river are the most turbulent in the world and home of exotic species practically unknown by the human being like the Pink Dolphin, an animal that manages to challenge the characteristics of its entire species to be able to survive in this wild habitat.
