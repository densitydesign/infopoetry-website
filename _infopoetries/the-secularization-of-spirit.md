  secularization was metaphorized through the narrowing of the holy iconography.

  The intention is to show clearly and irrefutably the numbers related to this
  reversal, which affects a milestone on the secular path of religion in Italy.
  The structure of the exhibition is also useful to analyze the "religious
  trend" within the Politecnico di Milano.
