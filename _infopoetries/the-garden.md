  1. Help people learn more about themselves. Based on the past time arrangement
  experience, better coordinate the arrangement of future plans. Help users
  develop good habits and become more self-disciplined, targeted and planned.

  2. In the current society, people pay more attention to the result and ignore the process. It seems that only the substantive and visible results can prove that a person's efforts during this period are valuable and meaningful. Therefore, many people have not achieved anything after a period of hard work. Such results will become self-doubt and loss of confidence. The plants carefully cultivated by users in each lesson represent each experience. It has feelings, experiences, and a person's hard work and sweat, and carries mood and memory. It is like a tree that belongs to itself and does not require external attention. It proves that it will grow and bear fruit by itself.

This is a digital garden. The value of the game initialization comes from the various data recorded by the software I used to focus on. According to the task difficulty, degree of completion, time spent and other information as the source of the initialization data in the game, such as the data presented in the game Plant level, energy value, mood value, etc. The growth law of the entire garden is a reflection of my personal habits. Players need to scientifically choose and plant low-level plants to achieve the goal of obtaining the ultimate plant. Just as in our life, if we need to achieve a difficult and huge goal, we need to learn various small goals reasonably in this process to gain growth and development.
