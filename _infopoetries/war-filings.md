  With this project i would like to reproduce the effects of explosives with
  iron filings. Iron filings are very small pieces of iron that look like a
  light powder. They are very often used in science demonstrations to show the
  direction of a magnetic field. Since iron is a ferromagnetic material, if some
  magnets are close to it, each particle come together to form a conglomerate.
  Due to his thorny and messy shape, the agglomeration generated by the magnetic
  field can be compared to the gun powder used in explosion, like the one
  generated by the burst of a bomb.
meaning: >
  The objective of this infopoetry is to provoke a feeling of repulsion and
  disdain mainly caused by the roughness and the sharpness of the iron powder.
  Besides, the spiny and chaotic nature of the iron filings allows to transmit a
  sense of toxicity and dangerousness, both features shared with the represented
  events.

In the Syrian civil war the factions involved in the conflict have destroyed cities and human lives with explosive and bombs. The thorny conglomerations of iron filings that are located over the most stricken cities show the density of the explosions, giving a sense of repulsion and disdain.
