The infopoetry illustrates some sketchy expressions of evocative emotions, which are superimposed on the image of my face. Normally, my countenance hides these vividly conflicting emotions, but in this instance, my face is hidden under them. I have made an ironic attempt to see how others would perceive my personality if they first saw these emotions rather than my typical facial expressions.
