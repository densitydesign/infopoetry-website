  name: "YouTube usage (October 21, 2022 – October 21, 2023). Obtained from
    Google: 10,746 videos viewed and 2,047 searches made."
metaphor: "To criticize YouTube as a virtuous platform, I want to relate it to a
  real virtuous tool: the nonfiction book. Therefore, I will imagine a
  speculative scenario in which any kind of video is converted to paper format,
  acquiring-apparently-the virtues of books. All these video books are stored in
  a library, which is responsible for preserving their cultural value. My
  dataset will thus be metaphorized by a series of books representing –
  ironically – my virtuous use of YouTube."
meaning: "It is a provocation toward the illusory responsible use of social
  networks – especially those deemed most innocuous. Diminishing the idea that
  YouTube is a tool for study and learning (or worse, that it is an alternative
  to true study and learning), I want to highlight instead the pervasiveness of
  the real content offered by the platform: entertainment. This is because,
  although I try to use YouTube as virtuously and constructively as possible, my
  watched history persuades me instead to support the thesis of technological
  determinism: in the end, it is always technology that dictates how we use it,
  in spite of our ideal intentions. And YouTube is not meant to be used
  virtuously."

YouTube is a huge platform that, when used virtuously, offers unlimited opportunities for free study and learning. But can it really be used virtuously? Through my personal watched history, the infopoem aims to highlight the  pervasiveness of YouTube and the asymmetry between entertainment and actual learning. Specifically, this is done through a speculative scenario in which videos are translated into books, ironically highlighting the contrast between format and content. At the center of this imaginary scenario is the Virtuous Video  Library, a library that collects and preserves this
content.
