Experimental attempt to use the data at sound level. Only 10% of those on the waiting list for a heart transplant actually get a heart transplant (50000 people on the waiting list, 5000 people get the transplant approximately). Thus the first 10 beats (in 10 seconds) corresponds to 1 (10%) and followed by 9 seconds of flat electrocardiogram sound (90% that does not get the transplant.) The aim is not to read this data immediately, but to use it in favor of a higher emotional yield, because the user perceives the big difference in time between the first group of beats and the second. The style is deliberately similar to that of a commercial to raise awareness, with the objective of giving the data a function beyond mere information.
