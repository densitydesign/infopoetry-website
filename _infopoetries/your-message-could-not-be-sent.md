  To make a reference with the world of printed postcards, the main element used
  to show different quantities of postcards is the stamp. Each stamp is equal to
  10.000.000 postcards. In this way the comparison through different years is
  expressed in a concrete way and is clearly visible to the user. 
meaning: >-
  The different amount of stamps wants to show how the use of this medium
  declined rapidly and in a short time, replaced from instant way of
  communication which grew in parallel: the number of printed postcards in the
  last 30 years has been more than halved.

Digital communication can improve any aspect of daily life but at the same time can lead to the disappearance of traditional printed media. The project wants to analyze this phenomenon in the context of travel. Are we still using postcards instead of sending instant pictures and messages?
