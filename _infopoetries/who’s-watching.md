  name: Daily use of the ‘Quit Smoking Today’ app.
metaphor: "Monitor: the collection of big data is like monitors after another
  monitoring the user's behavior. It makes the user think that the cell phone is
  a private space for him/her, but in reality there is no privacy to speak of.
  Marionette: The user and the phone are like a manipulated puppet, manipulated
  by the collectors behind it. Some app recommendations are given according to
  the user's habits. It seems to be for the user's preference, but in reality it
  is not manipulating the user's thinking orientation."
meaning: Although this is a health app that advocates users to record daily, but
  through the analysis of personal data records, it pushes an average of one
  advertisement for every 1.58 cigarettes smoked, and 82% of the advertisements
  are inextricably linked to the apps that I personally use on a daily basis.
  This is related to personalized recommendations through big data algorithms,
  based on technical analysis and processing of the user's personal behavioral
  habits, hobbies, or economic, health and credit status. But on the other side
  of the coin this can easily lead to excessive collection of personal
  information, or even the purchase of personal information. This can't help but
  make users feel like they are being monitored.

My infompoem is a model done after I went through the last month of using a smoking cessation app and collecting data on the ads he recommended and integrating them to categorize the connection with me. Where once I always pondered why these apps knew me so well, now I can’t help but start thinking about the purpose behind it. It makes us think about the security of mobile software, and whether our privacy is really private. How many invisible cameras are watching and recording us? And in what way will our data be used for their benefit?
