  In this metaphor through the white sheets and their empty spaces the
  percentage of the territory of the planet that does not belong to the
  mega-diverse nations. With the coloured leaves, the first positions and
  percentages in the flora and fauna species of the biodiversity of Colombia are
  highlighted, which is the second nation in the ranking after Brazil, which
  occupies the first place for its size. In another case, Colombia would occupy
  the first place for its diverse eco-systems. This makes the country unique and
  worthy of caring, valued and admired by all.

Only 10% of the planet's territory hosts more than 70% of biodiversity. Colombia occupies the first positions in different species and reminds us what apparently the contemporary man has forgotten: The universal meaning of Biodiversity.
