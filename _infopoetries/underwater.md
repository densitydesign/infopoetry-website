metaphor: "The metaphore is underwater, which is displayed in the photos I have
  taken, as well as in the audio file. Just like the song said: “My head was
  underwater”, the feeling of drowning, suffocating, helpless."
meaning: "Sound is very important and it affects a lot our emotional state.
  Emotions become attached to sound through experience, and emotions triggered
  by experience provoke certain thoughts and behaviors. That is why human beings
  have such a strong emotional response to the things we hear. Going through my
  Spotify playlist, I discovered that the No1 song listened by me in 2022 was
  Everything I wanted by Billie Eilish. It seemed like I found my self in the
  lyrics and the underwater sound effects of the song. "

"Underwater is exactly how I have felt in my year abroad. As much as my idea in my head was different, the reality hit me hard. Depression is a common mental disorder, which affects many people nowadays, and despite having heard for it for years, I never thought I would let it affect me.
I have displayed this feeling through 5 photos, accompanied by some of the lyrics of the song itself, as well as audio file from some of my voice memos this year. I want people to understand that going abroad as much fun as it can be, it can be very isolating and lonely, and if you let it, it might get into you and lead to bigger issues. The metaphore is underwater, which is displayed in the photos I have taken, as well as in the audio file. Just like the song said: “My head was underwater”, the feeling of drowning, suffocating, helpless. "
