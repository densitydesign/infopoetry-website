  name: Personal Google Maps timeline between home and Politecnico
metaphor: By tracing numerous places of interest within routine paths, the
  Google algorithm can be associated with a reporter/photojournalist, who
  travels with extreme attention, exploring, taking notes, in search of the
  notable element to be insert in his work. The intent is to retrace a daily
  trip with the same attention."
meaning: Daily journeys are often traveled mechanically, without paying
  particular attention to the surrounding landscape. On the contrary, Google
  Maps algorithm presents a much more attentive eye to the details of the travel
  and to the places that it is possible to meet. The intent is to arouse a
  reflective reaction in the user, highlighting the way in which the algorithm
  interferes with daily actions carried out mechanically, such as traveling
  between home and university, tracing and recording data of which the
  individual is unaware.

Following Googleâ€™s point of view, starting from the images of the interesting places that it already presents, retracing the tracked movements with a slower and more authorial look. The different stages of the journey will be reconsidered in order to be photographed again. It is thus possible to outline a photo-story, in which the images reconstruct the various stages of a daily journey highlighting their peculiar aspects.
