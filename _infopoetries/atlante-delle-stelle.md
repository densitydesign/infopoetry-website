The artifact represents the impact that man has had on the space around the Earth. Each piece of tinfoil paper represents ten wreckage pieces travelling in the Lower Earth Orbit, for a total of 1300 balls. The base on which the foil is glued is a map of the stars, as seen from our planet: for the observer, the garbage in space prevents you from seeing the whole starry sky. The aim is to create in the observer the desire to remove the tinfoil to better see what lies beneath.
