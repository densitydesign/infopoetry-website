  name: Google Maps dataset from a week’s usage.
metaphor: This app acts as a guiding light in the darkness. Just picture
  yourself in an unfamiliar, dimly lit area where every step is uncertain and
  daunting. But with this app at your fingertips, it's like having a reliable
  flashlight, making your journey easier, and your progress more assured. In
  essence, this app serves as our metaphorical guiding light in unfamiliar
  terrain.
meaning: The widespread integration of technology, especially applications like
  these, which exert a profound influence on our daily existence, highlights a
  growing dependence on technology over our innate abilities. Through this
  dataset, my intention is to emphasize the importance of these applications in
  our daily schedules, underscoring their pivotal role in aiding us with tasks
  that were once manually performed—such as recalling street names for
  independent navigation to our destinations.

The objective of this project is to visually illustrate my navigation and destinations from the past week, meticulously recorded within the Google Maps timeline. The underlying concept is to highlight my daily reliance on the application for locating destinations, navigating routes, and optimizing transportation choices for efficiency. The presentation unfolds on two posters, where one poster visually delineates
the specific locations I actively searched for, while the other portrays locations automatically recorded by the app itself.
