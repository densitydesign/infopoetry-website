metaphor: >-
  To visualize the information I tried to use as a metaphor the socks: in a game
  is certainly the first garment that gets dirtier and that keeps track of all
  the faults committed: the more the game is “ dirty “/ unfair (fouls whistled
  in a match) the more the sock is dirty. To show the cards per game I decided
  to use the aesthetic detail of the old socks: the height of the coloured line
  in the sock is proportional to the number of cards taken out during the whole
  game. 
meaning: >-
  In this way, my infopoetry wants to show a kind of timeline on the style of
  the game in the last twelve years where you can reflect on the referee’s
  severity compared to a possible change in the way of playing this sport.

The installation visualizes the amount of fouls in Italian soccer championship: the sock is the main symbol chosen to represent the toughness of the sport because it is the first thing that gets dirty during a  match and keeps tracks of all the episodes happened in the ninety minutes of the game.
