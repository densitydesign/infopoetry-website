  name: Spotify inferences (500+) about my lifestyle, my personality, my social
    class, my user and purchase habits, my interests, my work and much more
metaphor: The metaphor chosen is a visual personification of my digital double,
  trying to stress the human component of those assumptions and let the user
  perceive that they aren’t just words but labels with a huge weight. Algorithms
  assign those labels and divide us in those categories with a sort of
  lightness, but it’s important to remember that we’re talking about people with
  uniqueness.
meaning: The infopoem reflects on the insanely specific and biased inferences
  algorithms make about us, in a continuous exchange of informations between
  platforms. The aim was to underline also how our digital traces define us in
  ways that often do not reflect our person. The audience should be astonished
  by all the information algorithms “pretend” to know about us and make a
  critical reflection on how they label us to at least partially catch our needs
  and reuse them. The project also underlines how the final inferences an
  algorithm made and the results of a text-to-image models, dispel the myth of
  unbiased and objective AI.

The infopoetry represents the assumptions Spotify made about me, visually translated with a text-to-image AI by using each inference as a prompt. The resulting images are merged proportionally to create the face of my digital double, according to those algorithms and their stereotypes.
