The theme that inspired the work is that of the seismic events that hit central Italy from August 2016 until January 2017. The idea is to visualize a human "swarm", represented by the messages sent and received by the people affected by the earthquake, a positive network, created by all those who have mobilized to help; a chain within, between and above the events and words, consisting of names and surnames and moments, which remain imprinted and accumulate creating tangible volumes and in a sensing material.
