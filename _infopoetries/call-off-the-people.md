  When trying to solve any problem or an issue, people need to have ‘a complete
  picture’ of it. Because of this, I decided to present the information in a
  form of a puzzle.  By moving the pieces in the correct order, at the end, one
  is completely informed about the problem.

  With this project, I would like to provoke people to be more aware of their
  behavior and make them understand the importance and severity of this problem.
  Because, even though some people may be aware, the solution for the problem of
  stray dogs does not exist.
