  When iron meets air and water, it reacts, rusts, and corrodes the iron, until
  it eats up the whole iron. We can see the corroded iron but not the iron
  reacting with air and water. And the whole process, like emotional abuse, can
  erode the mental health of a growing child, although there is no "visible way"
  to destroy a child,  as a beating. So I use rust to represent emotional abuse,
  and the whole thing will represent Australia

  Emotional abuse is considered a harmful element of domestic violence. How does
  it affect children? We need to understand the dangers of emotional abuse to
  provide support to victims of emotional abuse

Emotional abuse is considered a harmful element of domestic violence. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3.3 million Australians have been emotionally abused by a partner since the age of 15. Emotional abuse is destructive to a child's development.
