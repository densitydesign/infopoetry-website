metaphor: >-
  Starting from the audio element, the installation would consist in different
  speakers placed around a central point, where there would be an information
  panel placed on the ground, that would explain the aim of the project. Each
  speaker would reproduce a different sound reported in the datasheet, with a
  variable volume accorded to the percentage of complainings. Under each
  speaker, there would be reported the percentage represented.
meaning: >-
  The main idea of the installation is to create a new perception. The listener
  would be bothered from an uncomfortable noise, trying to identify the source.
  Through this installation, I would like to make the listener understand the
  impact of human activity on urban life.

The urban development has given an impact to the world natural assessment, and, either if some pollution forms are tackled, what about the ones that we neglect? The infopoetry highlights how the artificial noise is becoming increasingly intrusive in our life, creating a constant background sound.
