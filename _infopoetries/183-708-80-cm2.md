How much area of canvas does a painter paint during his life? How much color does he use? An interesting answer can be found in Mondrian, who dedicated almost 30 years of his artistic life to paintings funded on a double principle: the size of orthogonal geometric surfaces and the exclusive use of primary colors. Forty-one of this kind of paintings, known as “Compositions” and realized between 1918 and 1943, have been here “de-composed” in order to quantify the area of canvas occupied by each color. These surfaces have been then summed for creating a new Composition, which summarizes the well-known Mondrian’s art pieces.
