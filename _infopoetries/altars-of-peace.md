  Candles:

  - The time passes and you can't recover it.

  - It has a religious connotation.

  - Time Lit= Time on Youtube


  Images:

  - They show who is the saint you are praying to.

  - In this case, to show the most viewed youtube channels.
meaning: I feel that I often look to watch YouTube as an easy escape from my
  daily life, searching for meaning and connection, aspects that historically
  man has sought to find in God. As a believer, I believe that people can place
  social networks in the place of God, and the time and frequency with which we
  use them can fulfill an almost religious role.

In the digital sanctuary, beside cyber-churches, stands an altar of connection—a haven where devotees pray and kindle digital candles. The candles, witnesses to time’s fleeting flow, remind us of its irretrievable nature. Here, worshipped figures are YouTube idols, custodians of modern wisdom and sacred entertainment. Arranged in rows and columns like traditional altars, the candles unveil our real-life viewing history—a chart of highs and lows, moments of reflection, and distraction. Thus, in the dimness of this modern altar, candles glow as symbols of our worship of information, fusing the divine and the digital in a unique liturgy illuminating the journey of our connected existence.
