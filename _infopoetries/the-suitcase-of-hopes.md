  The suitcase can be considered one of the symbol of immigrants. I have
  therefore decided to transform it from the bearer of the essential objects
  that are brought when restarting life in a new place to the bearer of the
  hopes at the root of the decision to live your country of birth. The suitcase
  is full of postcards that shows the reasons behind the intention to immigrate.
meaning: >-
  The effect I want to provoke is a reflection that people, reading the
  postacards and locking at the suitcase, can have on the reasons that brings
  the Italian immigrants to leave their country. We all listen  every day about
  migration, but for some people, it is often the only object that accompanies
  them constantly. I would like the observer of the work to develop a new
  awareness about the topic, trying to give everything less for granted.

Immigration is usually seen as a displacement of people. However, going deeper, we can find that the driving engine inside each of them that powers this movement is a hope. In this artefact wants to give a slight light on the reasons behind the decision of Italians to leave Italy.
