metaphor: >-
  The metaphor is realized in a sculpture that depicts a bed in which only a
  woman is present. Her husband, whose absence is highlighted by a groove in the
  mattress, is replaced by 29 "signs" that are used by homeless people to beg.
  The husband has thus "turned" into a symbol of being homeless.  Each sign
  represents 1000 homeless people.
meaning: >-
  I want that the person looking at my infopoetry is confronted with an
  apparently stereotypical scene, which nevertheless lacks one of the
  fundamental elements, namely one of the two partners. Having grasped the sense
  of the infopoetry, I hope he/she will reflect on the power he can have on the
  person he/she loves most.

Have you ever wondered how a beggar becomes one? Half of the times, it's because they have been abandoned by their partner.
