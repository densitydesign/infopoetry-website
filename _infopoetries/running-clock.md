metaphor: >-
  The length of the stride is used to represent the number of movement steps;
  The time points pointed by the span distance represent the time taken to
  complete the steps.
meaning: >-
  How much time does it take people of their steps every day. The number of
  exercise steps per day is 24 hours,but the real countable time does not
  include the sleep time, so excluding the sleep time per day, the remaining
  time is closely related to the number of exercise steps, we can discover how
  many time people spend on the steps they take per day.

This is a time that everyone is health-conscious, most people have opened the function of recording the number of exercise steps in their mobile phone. The clock will show the length of exercise directly affects the number of steps people take per day.
