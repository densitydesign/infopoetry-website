"Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. He worked in some different studios, that he called Factory and each one became a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities. The Factories of Warhols were five, each situated in different places in New York and used from him in different years. Basing on these informations, I have divided each work of Andy Warhol (including films, sculptures, photographs, etc) into five periods corresponding to each Factories. To represent this dataset, I chose one of the famous work of the artist “Marilyn” (1967) consists of 10 screenprints of the actress; I selected five of them and I associated a different colour of her face with each factory. So each Marilyn represents a Warhol’s single work that he created in different places and years. At the end I used this little Marilyn to form the word “FACTORY”, from which it appears that the most productive period of Warhol’s career was from 1963 to 1967 in the Factory 231 East 47th street."
