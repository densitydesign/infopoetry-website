  name: All the emojis I used in my life-sharing in Wechat
metaphor: I hope to make the output the same style as the word explanation in
  the dictionary and interprets meoji in a canonical format. The reason for
  choosing this metaphor is that I want emoji to look like words and become a
  language that can be used by people for communication.
meaning: I like using emojis to express myself. As a symbolic language, a big
  difference between emoji and text is that the emojis have more possibilities
  to be used and imagined according to different context. Through this project,
  I would like to let everyone start to think about the possibility of images as
  a communication medium, to explore the ability and boundaries of images to
  express meaning.

"The <meoji> means MY EMOJI. I collect all the emojis I used in Wechat and I want to explore the potential of emoji as a popular symbolic language in terms of expression and communication. Emoji is flexible, one emoji can have completely different meanings depending on the context, and different emojis also could represent the same meaning.

Based on my data, I collected different emojis that represent the same meaning and combine them to express a specific meaning as <meoji>.
