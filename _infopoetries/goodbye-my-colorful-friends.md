  name: Information about 77 items I sold on Xianyu.
metaphor: The metaphor is a piece of souvenir photo. I paint each makeup to look
  like a person. Then they appeared in a group photo. It's looks like each
  makeup has a life, they stay with me for a long or short time, and then they
  was separated from me, and then I put them in an album.
meaning: My second-hand makeup data reflects some of my life trajectories and
  stories:How I bought them, used them, and why I sold them. From these stories,
  the audience can see the connection and intersection between me as a consumer
  and certain products at some point in the past. I want to show people the
  relationship between me and objects in a relaxed and pleasant visual form.

I sold on Xianyu app and created a set of illustrations based on the product information and sales records in the data set. In this set of illustrations, I compare 77 makeup to different friends, and the process of selling used makeup to say goodbye and remember friends. The whole set of illustrations looks like a souvenir group photo. In the picture, these makeup artists are created in an anthropomorphic way, and the story behind each product will be recorded in a more relaxed and pleasant visual language. From these stories, the audience can see the connection and intersection between me as a consumer and certain products at some point in the past.
