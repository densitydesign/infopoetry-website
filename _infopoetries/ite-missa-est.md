metaphor: >-
  A prayer or a chant in which the single voices' intensity represents the
  percentage of people attending church at least once a week (the higher the
  percentage, the higher the sound's intensity) supported by a graphical
  representation of quantity (candlelight) the candle burns out in time based on
  the total percentage of people attending religious services.
meaning: >-
  The infopoetry intends to stimulate a reflection on religious practices
  through the solemnity and mysticism of the chant/prayer metaphor, making the
  viewer and listener ponder if the drop in faith in Italian people is for
  better or for worse.

Slowly but relentlessly, Italians are dropping the worship of God at the Holy Sunday Mass. Ite, Missa Est explores the reality of a detuned faith through an unsetting experience.
