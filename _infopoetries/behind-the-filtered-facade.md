metaphor: The exhibition is created from the content creator perspective,
  offering personal insight into their experiences and the pressures they face
  in the digital landscape. It humanizes the influencer and allows viewers to
  connect the process of creation, rather than simply consuming their image or
  the brand content.
meaning: Just as a scrapbook's pages are carefully arranged to create a cohesive
  narrative, an influencer's Instagram posts and stories are carefully crafted
  to project a specific image. A scrapbook mirrors the world of a content
  creator, reflecting the curated content, created in collaboration with brands
  and the personal experiences behind the carefully constructed facade.
