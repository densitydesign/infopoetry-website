  name: "Mobike bike-sharing app: total kilometers traveled and route length in
    four years"
metaphor: The message is meant to be passed through a conversion of the total
  kilometers I have traveled through bike share services into liters of gasoline
  not consumed (according to average l/km car consumption values). 95.1 km ->
  7.1 L
meaning: In recent years, shared bikes have invaded big cities, generating a new
  way of understanding getting around; in fact, it is now possible to take a cab
  because it's raining in the morning but bike back in the afternoon because the
  sun has come out. One is no longer bound to the bulky motor vehicle, I have
  experienced this on my own skin making the step from the small town where
  distances are stretched and the car becomes an obligation, to the
  super-connected grid of Milan where sharing services are widespread and often
  save from traffic as well as promote a green approach to mobility. From this
  reflection came the idea of representing bike sharing in the language of
  combustion engine vehicles and thus highlighting the nonuse of gasoline that
  these choices entail.

A fuel can filled with the liters of gasoline saved (7.1L) from using the bike share service instead of the car. Two labels on the can to explain the conversion and highlight minor data such as number of trips and average trip distance.
