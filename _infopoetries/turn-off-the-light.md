  name: “Smartphone addiction in the UK” by Statista
metaphor: >-
  Light is always something that people follow, feel attracted to, but is also
  used to create the idea of movement, traffic, music. The metaphor in this
  infopoetry is the use of the screen light, a light that keeps constantly
  demanding our attention and becoming an extension of our needs.
meaning: >-
  The number of times people use mobile devices have increased exponentially
  through the years. The intention of this infopoetry is to make the audience
  aware of the addition that most of us have and cause discomfort with the
  reality that we live in and hopefully a willingness to change the behaviour.

Smartphones are taking over our lives, across the world, the sight of heads bowed over small screens is everywhere. This project explores the addiction that we have towards our phones, how we use them in almost every situation in our daily life and how we became so detached from our surroundings.
