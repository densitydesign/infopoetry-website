The Brazilian Amazon Forest. How it looks today and how it might look in the future.
The project aims to raise awareness of the phenomenon of deforestation in Amazonian areas, particularly in Brazil. The data relating to the situation are represented through the use of the evocative image of a leaf, in which the missing parts are for the areas of forest razed to the ground.
