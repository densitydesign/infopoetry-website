  name: Record of search history and the results provided on Spotify, from August
    to October 2023.
metaphor: The chosen metaphor is an poster that provides different information
  if you read it with or without a lens. By using the lens, the visitor can see
  a simulation of artist suggestions from Spotify search queries, while if the
  user approach the poster without the lens, they can see more results, outside
  of my preexisting preferences.
meaning: My design wants to communicate exactly how i feel when i see Spotify
  suggestions. It feels like I am seeing filtered results even though i didn't
  opt for it. It is like a lens that prevents me from seeing everything, instead
  it redirects me to what I already know, so there's less room for accidental or
  spontaneous exploration.

The data set reveals Spotify’s meticulous tailoring of suggestions. The algorithm,
prioritizing familiarity, (maybe) unintentionally constructs a filter bubble. Red Lists 256 unordered artists while light blue, visible with a lens, displays the seven suggested ones, the ones that are inside my preferences: liked songs, genres, artists, etc. This visual representation encapsulates the tension between personalized curation and the potential loss of diverse musical discovery within algorithmic echo chambers. The project questions the balance between
personalization and exploration, symbolizing how algorithms shape our digital experiences.
