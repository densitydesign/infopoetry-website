metaphor: >-
  It consists of a physical representation of the 3890 exoplanets as spheres.
  They are made manually with polymer clay and they are collected in a
  container. Only 14 of them are made in FIMO of three different colour shades:
  blue, green and red. They are the representation of habitable exoplanets. The
  blue and the green establish a link between the Earth’s colours in the
  collective imagination and the habitable exoplanets, instead of the red, which
  brings out the difference between the exoplanets and our planet. The other
  3876 spheres are made in DAS and they have a neutral colour. 
meaning: >-
  “Another Earth” wants to make people aware of the existence of the topic and
  also of how hard is to find habitable exoplanets.

The infopoetry focuses on the hard research of habitable planets beyond the Earth. It is a physical representation of the 3890 known exoplanets as spheres. They are made with polymer clay. Only 14 of them differ from the other in the colour. The users have to find the coloured ones.
