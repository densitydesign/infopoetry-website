  The metaphor develops in two levels:

  1. the user has to put himself into a “risky” situation to see the panels;

  2. the dataset is shown thanks to a visual treemap of empty landscape images
  as if the “portrait’s subject” was meant to be there, but only felt thanks to
  the presence of hashtags.

  Taking selfies is considered to be a mode of self-expression in today’s
  generation like looking in a mirror. Selfies are well popular among Facebook,
  Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest users. It is rewarding for individuals
  seeing the number of likes and positive comments and this further influences
  them to post unique pictures which may also involve indulging in risky
  behaviors to click selfies.
