  name: Photos taken in the past 5 years in which I present a different hairstyle
metaphor: The concept identity relates back to both the Pirandellian concept of
  the mask and Jung's archetypes. A person is many entities at once and each
  behaves differently, one nature alien to the other, yet all coexisting within
  the same body.  The goal is to give voice to as many versions of self as
  possible, but how?  As time passes, we grow and change, partly overwriting
  ourselves infinite times. Therefore, itâ€™s possible to say that people can also
  be considered as layers of being.   What if it was possible to materialise our
  layers? What if we could look at all the versions of ourselves that have
  existed and still exist within our soul?
meaning: Those who will interact with the infopoem are supposed to be lead into
  reflecting on the concept of the evolution of identity to which we are all
  subjected in one way or another.

The artefact is a set of transparent acetate sheets with photos of myself presenting a different hairstyle. Users can recombine the sheets to create and unveil new identities. The aim is to use the outer shell of my persona as a translation of what is hidden behind it.
