metaphor: >-
  One of the reasons why noise pollution goes unnoticed is that it is a sequence
  of noises whose main characteristic is not intensity, but constancy. It is
  usually an unnoticeable sustained background noise. 

  The term 'background noise' becomes the metaphor to read the info-poetry: the
  noise is translated into a visual disturbance, whose intensity depends on the
  percentage of population affected by this phenomenon.
meaning: >-
  The core idea is to make people reflect on the meaning of noise pollution, as
  a background noise that itâ€™s really difficult to perceive.

The noise pollution is like the ticking of a clock in a silent room: an annoying background, which you are used to and no longer perceive. Through audiovisual synaesthesia, the infopoetry shows an overview of the population of European capitals exposed by acoustic pollution.
