metaphor: >
  I created a visual mash-up combining analogue and digital suggestions. Through
  the vinyl structure, I evoke the roots of the listening practice of the
  twentieth century. On the other hand, I recall music production software’s
  interfaces, that opened the door of Sound Design to anybody with a computer. 
meaning: >-
  Through this work, I aim to foster curiosity towards the practice of sampling,
  as I’m conscious that people are not aware of the relevance of this technique
  in sound design. I wish to generate astonishment, to let people listen to
  well-known music from a different perspective.

This artefact is meant to support the exploration of the musical world beyond Daft Punk’s Discovery, revealing the roots and the impact of this milestone of electronic music. It displays the number of times each song has been sampled by later artists and shows the samples contained in every track.
