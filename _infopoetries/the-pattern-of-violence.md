metaphor: >-
  The main medium in this installation is clothes. I chose them because they are
  always closest to the body, and often cover the traces of physical violence.
  They are also the carrier of a lot of information about the person who wears
  them. The red colour will symbolize signs of violence. White fabrics will be a
  symbol of defenselessness and innocence. 
meaning: >-
  I want to show that it is worth talking about this problem, demonstrating
  data, exposing torturers and convincing women that violence is not normal
  behaviour and it is worth seeking help from specialized services. The
  visualization is to be convinced by comparing the scale of violence and the
  scale of seeking help.

The installation tells the story of violence against women. Seemingly it is a dress with a floral pattern, but after reading the label, we discover the hidden truth about the scale of domestic violence that affects women in Europe.
