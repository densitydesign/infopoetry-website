  name: The dataset is based on Telegram app conversations with friends during the
    starting period of Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine, from February
    2022.
metaphor: Through printed “vintage” looking telegrams merged with modern chat
  excepts I want to create a clear narrative storyline demonstrating the similar
  importance inherent in both modern time and historical forms of communication
  during crises. The metaphor accentuates the continuity of distanced
  communication methods across different eras, stressing the emotional nuances
  inherent in contemporary digital communication during conflicts.
meaning: “TELEFILOI” seeks to convey the depth of distant conflicts beyond main-
  stream media depictions. The  project centers on sharing a personal nar-
  rative which is crucial in communicating the complexity of the war in Ukraine.
  This approach aims to foster empathy and deeper comprehension among foreign
  audiences, surpassing the limitations of conventional me- dia portrayals and
  offering a more nuanced understanding of the multi- faceted emotions and
  experiences underlying historical events; explore distanced communication and
  friendship during hardships.

“Telefiloi” is an archive of my online conversations with friends during the invasion of
Ukraine in 2022. Our ongoing exchanges form a narrative, reflecting our joint journey through the war. This project aims to provide an intimate perspective of friendship and the significance of distanced digital communication that bears profound emotional value during the times of crisis.
