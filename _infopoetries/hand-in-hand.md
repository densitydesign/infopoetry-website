The focus point of this collection of images are hands â€” a powerful tool of non-verbal communication. Each image invites the viewer to decipher the depth of these interactions. The intention of the project is not only to encapsulate and reflect on the connections from the past, but also provoke the viewers to pay more attention to the ones that they are experiencing on daily occasions. Another goal is also to show how nuanced the nature of nonverbal communication can be and that there are endless ways in which hands can express emotions, convey messages, and contribute to the overall language of communication.
