  name: Facebook activity data over years (from account creation until today),
    divided into personal information, interactions, connection and a lot more.
metaphor: "This message is communicated through the main symbol of this
  exhibition: obviously the armchair. The concept is then develdped through a
  physical space; in which the armchair is at the center. Under pillow, it has
  several rolls of paper with chaotic data spilling out and unrolling on the
  floor."
meaning: We are able to perceive our active usage (posts, comments, likes etc.),
  but we don't actually see that in the meanwhile the algorithm is creating a
  digital twin of ourselves, made by billions of datas.

“Poltroncina” is the first and only research I did on Facebook, during my whole user activity. This iconic example fully represents the presence that Facebook had and still has in my life: something which is completely marginal and meaningless regarding my life and my person; a social network that I used for a few years just
to scroll some posts without interacting and creating that much. I mean… at least, this is what it seems like. Am I really sure that this perception that I have corresponds to the reality of facts? ls Facebook really secondary on my daily routine? What hidden data lies behind that armchair?
