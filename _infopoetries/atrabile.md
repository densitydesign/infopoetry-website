Sevdah is a feeling about life imbued with melancholy, yearning and beautiful sorrow. Since the Ottoman dominion it has become a fundamental part of Balkans costumes and traditions. Etymologically the term is of Arabic origin and stands for black bile. Atrabile is a collection of black drenched papers telling the stories of post war mental disorders in the Balkans.
