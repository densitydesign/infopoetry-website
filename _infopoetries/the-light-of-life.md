With this visualization is possible to see what’s the average max age of people from different types of country (divided geographically and by wealth) during the last 50 years (1960-2013). It’s possible to see a general increase in the average max age, especially in richer countries. Sub-saharan Africa and South Asia are generally the least vital, where North America is the most. The visualization uses the lighting bulbs as a metaphor: when the bulb dies, the average max year of the country is finished. The visualization is enhanced using the sound: the death of a bulb is underlined by a specific sound.
