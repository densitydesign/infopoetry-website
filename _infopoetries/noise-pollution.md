metaphor: Scratches on the disc indicate damage to human hearing caused by noise.
meaning: >-
  I want to use animation to present the corners of life that are ubiquitous but
  easily overlooked, such as noise. It not only has a hearing-impairing effect
  on humans but even for animals, it also affects its lifestyle and migration.
  The noise interferes with each other's life, I hope to cause people to
  reflect, how to reduce these effects, and build a beautiful home.
