Deads News tells about the thousands of journalists dead for terrorist's attacks. Info's are gathered from Committee to Protect Journalists and include information of more than 1100 both men and women dead for free information. The emotional level it is given by the sounds, by the initial personal view, by the story of every single journalist through the cross and other different information. (Dead News it's a word game with the expression "Bad News".)
