    March to June 2022

  As for metaphor, I want to use the pin in order to “highlight” the day of
  catcall episode.

  The pins will have 2 features:

  1. to pin the piece of paper with the location, time, and phrase

  2. to represent an act of “hurting” or ”being pricked”.


  Pinned notes will look like the phone’s notes where I was actually writing my data when the catcalling happened in order to reflect the “realness” of that moment.


  The paper notes will probably have glossy finish, so when the person touches it, s/he would

  leave finger stains on them to give the feeling of “dirtiness” that this topic is associated with for me, as well as effect of “touching something personal” when you leave your fingerprints."
meaning: The topic touches on the issue of catcalling which is a type of verbal
  abuse that is culturally sanctioned and socially accepted. It may also create
  an unsafe and uncomfortable environment for people experiencing it and brings
  up to the surface very disturbing tendencies of the way women are perceived in
  today’s society and the level of education of men. Since it is a common issue
  for many women around the world, visualizing it might help understand others
  what and how often women have to experience it on regular basis based on my
  example. Maybe this project might be a very small step in a big journey of
  mind-shifting to help make the cities safer for everyone.

“CatCallendar” is a collection of my catcalling experience during the period of 4 months in a form of a calendar where I highlight the days of catcalling episodes by attaching the notes with the date, time, location, and the phrase if I could understand it. By seeing the attached notes the viewer can easily calculate the average frequency of these events and, perhaps, discover how unpleasing, frustrating, and irritating it might feel to be objectified each time you go out on the street by the provided description details on these notes.
