  The metaphor captures the reading experience in which words are read without
  being fully understood.

  Essay → a text that has continuity and requires attention to be understood

  Missing words → words that have been lost because distraction led me elsewhere

  Essay with gaps → the reading of the text is compromised because some parts are missing
meaning: "The distraction is visualized as a white space, interpretable on one
  side as a 'gap' and on the other as 'free space.' The user is encouraged to
  reflect on their relationship with it: does it result in a loss (of time and
  meaning), or is it an opportunity to discover something else?"

I easily get distracted: during conversation, walking down the street, while reading. Blank Space recreates the experience in which the rhythm of reading is interrupted by external input like notifications, ideas that pop out and links found. The distractions are visualized through white spaces that shift the underlying text based on the number of words that could be read in that time span. The project aims to
provoke a reflection on the meaning that we associate with our daily distractions: does it result in a loss of time and meaning, or is it an opportunity to discover something else?
