  name: Own data to determine the average amount of time spent on Instagram in
    three months.
metaphor: >-
  This metaphorical representation is intended to evoke a sense of reflection
  and realization in

  the user. By visualizing the trade-off between Instagram and reading, users may become

  more aware of the time they spend on social media and its impact on their intellectual

  growth. It aims to encourage users to reconsider their digital habits, allocate more time to

  reading, and enrich their lives through literature.
meaning: >-
  The intention is to highlight the opportunity cost of spending excessive time
  on Instagram in an impactful way. The metaphor emphasizes the books left
  unread due to time spent on social

  media. The argument is that we often underestimate the cumulative impact of small actions

  (like scrolling through Instagram) on our lives. By realigning our priorities and investing more

  time in reading, we can gain knowledge, insights, and experiences that are often lost in the

  digital void.

In an era dominated by mass media and the myriad distractions introduced by social platforms into our daily lives, itâ€™s alarmingly easy to lose sight of the substantial time we invest in trivial pursuits, essentially squandering moments without meaningful returns. Through this informational poetry installation, my goal is to shed light on these overlooked instances of time loss. By illustrating, through my own three-month Instagram data, the vast potential for acquiring deep knowledge and awareness through reading books instead of mindlessly scrolling, I aim to provoke awareness and encourage a more purposeful use of our precious time.
