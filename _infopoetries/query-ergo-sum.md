  name: Safari and Google search on computer and phone, in December 2023.
metaphor: To talk about the theme, the metaphor of visibility/ invisibility was
  selected, which represents the actual condition of those who use the Internet
  and thus are present but at the same time remain invisible because they cannot
  be profiled. This is conveyed by the magazine through the alternation of blank
  and transparent pages that render the presence/ absence duality. The metaphor
  and the application of it to an editorial and paper product comes to life from
  the works of Vincenzo Agnetti and Emilio IsgrÃ².
meaning: >-
  The infopoem aims to make the observer reflect with respect to online
  invisibility and to answer the question: how does it feel to be a ghost
  online?

  In the digital context in which we are immersed, it is possible to experience a paradox of existence: to be present online but at the same time not to be there, not to be visible.

What happens to our digital data when we
manage to evade tracking and profiling?
When you do not accept cookies, browse only
in undercover mode, and the data that are
usually used to profile a digital twin remain
only scattered traces. Even though we are
present on the web we remain invisible, our
traces are dispersed among billions of data,
and the searches we make vanish as soon as
we close the device. I designed a magazine
whose pages are an alternation between blank
pages and acetate pages printed with white
ink. What happens when pages overlap and the
information shown is not visible?
