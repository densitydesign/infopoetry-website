  The temporal dimension is the element I want to focus the attention on. To
  represent it, I decided to use an object of daily use: the belt, an accessory
  normally used to hold clothing items such as trousers and skirts. Often the
  addition of holes on it reflects the changes in weight (weight loss) of the
  wearer. In the project it is transformed into a timeline identifying itself as
  a ‘line of life’ with the intent of representing a period of time that goes
  from the beginning of the disease. Through the use of a punching machine 36
  holes were drilled all at the same distance, which ideally represents one
  month. Regarding the number of people who answered the online survey, each one
  is metaphorically represented through the negative (remaining part) of a hole.

  Often the sources that deal with the theme ‘eating disorders’ report data on
  the number of admissions or deaths, omitting the information on what precedes
  these events. On the contrary, with this project I want to put the observer’s
  attention on a psychological aspect of the pathology: the difficulty
  inadmitting to having a problem and therefore the consequent need to contact
  someone else to be helped. The very title of the project ‘Stretto in vita’ has
  a double meaning, on the one hand the verb ‘stringere’ understood as - ridursi
  di dimensioni, restringersi - which represents the physical dimension of the
  object that narrows with the passage of time, index of weight loss, on the
  other hand in its meaning of - avvinghiarsi, aggrapparsi - reflects the desire
  not to let go and struggle to regain possession of one’s own life.

Recognizing that you need help is the first step towards healing, but often the hardest to do.
‘Stretto in vita’ is a project that, through the use of a belt that turns into a ‘linea della vita’, shows how
long people suffering from anorexia nervosa are turning to doctors and experts in order to heal.
