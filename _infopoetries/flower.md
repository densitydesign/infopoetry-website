metaphor: >-
  I want to take the seed number as mother fertility and the flower flake
  falling number as maternal mortality. The metaphor is because the flowers gave
  the seed life but sacrificed themselves, it's the same as that human mother
  give birth to children but sacrificed themselves in this dataset. 

  I want children to remember the love of their mothers before we are born. And
  also we need to care about fertility health all over the world.
meaning: >
  I want to show the reproductive health situation globally. First, in some
  third world countries, the situation is very terrible. People need to care
  about them. Second, we need to cherish our lives and respect our mothers,
  because the fertility is very hard for mothers.

The dataset is the maternal mortality ratio in 2015. The flower flake number is projected as the maternal mortality ratio number. Flowers would sacrifice and give the next generations life, which is the same as that mothers give birth to next generations but sacrifice themselves due to fertility.
