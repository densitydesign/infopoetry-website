metaphor: >-
  Expressing how many people renounce to a certain action, the metaphor compares
  these memories that have to be forgotten to torn photos kept in an album. The
  higher the number of homosexuals renouncing to an action is, the more the
  photo that portrays that action will be torn. 
meaning: >-
  The intention of the project is to focus on those situations that for everyone
  seem daily and obvious, but for a group of people stigmatized by society and
  victims of prejudice, it may actually represent a cause of anxiety and
  possible danger.

In 2019 in France, one of the most gay-friendly country in Europe, 63% of homosexuals had to renounce to kiss their partners to avoid attacks driven by homophobia. The percentage of gays giving up this and other actions is represented in this album through the collection of torn photos.
