  name: ASAPS
metaphor: >-
  Each spoke of the wheel represents a food delivery rider who got into an
  accident. The bicycle spokes have been bent, cut or detached from the rim,
  metaphorically suffering the damage that the victim of an accident has
  suffered. The result is a broken wheel that reflects a flawed food delivery
  system.
meaning: >-
  The aim of the infopoetry is to make people aware of the growing number of
  accidents involving food delivery riders, and highlight what can result from
  the lack of attention, not only by the riders and drivers, but also by the
  food delivery services in ensuring the road safety of their employees.

From 2018 to 2019 the ASAPS association registered 32 food delivery riders involved in an accident, highlighting a problem which often remains overlooked. The Infopoetry represents each victim with a spoke of a bicycle wheel, which has been deformed depending on the damage suffered by the rider.
