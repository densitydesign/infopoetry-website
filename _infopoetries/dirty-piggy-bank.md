metaphor: A large glass piggy bank
meaning: My infopoem doesn't want to convey a specific meaning. Its goal is to
  let the spectators think about the relationship beetween a product that
  criticizes the obsession for money, and the ironic amount of money that said
  product earned.

Isn’t it ironic how a series that shows money in a negative light is also the one that made Netflix the most revenue it had ever earned? “Dirty Piggy Bank” uses motion graphics to try to bring the irony of Squid Game to the spectator’s eyes.
