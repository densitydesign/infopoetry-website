'Kintsukuroi'  is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with golden lacquer.
In this installation, this is a metaphor for depression and recovering from it.
If such astounding beauty can emerge from the shards of a vase, could a similar transformation also be possible with the parts of us we believe are shattered beyond repair?
'Wounds turn to wildflowers in time'.
