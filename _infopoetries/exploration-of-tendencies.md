  Two metaphors are used in order to depict chosen dataset: 

  1)Tree rings. The quality of each ring reflects the cycle of growth during a particular year. Every tree ring pattern of growth is unique. Every tree ring is shaped by circumstances that occurred during the years, they can ‘speak’ about the past.

  2)Sound waveforms. Sound waves are tangible

  representations of the sounds. each sound is unique

  due to having different amplitude, frequency, wavelength, time period and speed sound waves can resemble representation of a heartbeat/ECG → emotions.
meaning: Music, or more precisely, sounds are an important part of our everyday
  life and they are deeply intertwined with our emotions, thoughts and behavior.
  The main intention behind this work is to show the connection between my
  personal growth and chosen dataset. In other words, to capture in a tangible
  way my listening habits throughout the opted timeline in order to see my
  maturation.

Supported by metaphors of tree rings and soundwaves, this work aims to show identified trends and ‘comfort zone’ collected in a certain period of time, that are depicted through relevant and emphasized patterns.
