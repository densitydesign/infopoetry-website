metaphor: >-
  I would use the metaphor of applying a filter (pixelation, blurâ€¦) to the body
  as a resort to cosmetic surgery procedures. Therefore, images of a female and
  a male body would be divided into areas (the ones addressed by cosmetic
  procedures) and a filter would be applied on them proportionally: the stronger
  the filter the higher the number of procedures performed in the area. The
  result would be two body images with some areas at a regular definition and
  others heavily blurred/pixelated and unrecognizable. 
meaning: >-
  I would like to provoke, at first, an emotional reaction of surprise and shock
  in people looking at the InfoPoetry. They would see a body, that could be
  their one, heavily blurred and somewhere obliterated and they would realize
  that it shows the effects of mass-cosmetic surgery. After I would like the
  user to reflect about the risk of losing individual identity and features
  through this body-reshaping process and, maybe, to think about the impact of
  beautified-body images that today are not just common but normal.

Today the demand for surgical cosmetic procedures is stronger than ever all over the world. What is the role played by the constant exposition to images of ideal and idealized bodies? What is and what could become the impact of this body-reshaping on individual identity?
