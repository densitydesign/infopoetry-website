  name: Smartphone usage in daily life, data collected from the Digital Wellbeing
    app for Android and found in the App Usage.
metaphor: In an attempt to consider the number of hours spent on the internet as
  hours spendable in offline activities, and among these having examined the
  reading of a book, the metaphor I used would be to consider time as pages of
  books. How many days of smartphone use would Jane Austenâ€™s novel Pride and
  Prejudice correspond to?
meaning: In 2022 in Italy we spent approximately 6 hours of our waking time
  connected to the internet, half of which connected through our smartphones.
  Personally, I check my phone 4 times an hour, counting an average of 16 over
  24 time slots of daily use. We could define it as addiction, yet we cannot
  deny how the internet is increasingly useful to us, helping to facilitate many
  of our daily actions. How many of the hours spent on the internet are wasted
  time? Is highly persuasive design fueling our addiction to smartphones? Or do
  we simply need some extra power? And why not consider the environmental costs
  of the technological infrastructures that allow fast and uninterrupted
  connectivity today?

There are many activities that we could carry out without necessarily using our phone: cooking, working out at the gym, doing volunteer work, spending time with friends, learning a new language, going to a concert or reading a book. But are we really ready to turn off our smartphones? In Digital Vice, over a period of 37 days, the minutes spent touching, unlocking and interacting with the phone are related to the quantity of pages I could have read. Having considered four different reading speeds that texts would entail, the pages were added up until a total of nine books was reached: a novel, philosophical texts, an exhibition catalog, and books on design.
