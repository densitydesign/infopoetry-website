  A Physical world Map illustrating dataset using Straws in vertical direction
  to plot the map. The height of the straw shows the amount of plastic waste
  generation by each country.

  The aim is to show the life of a single plastic product, for example: Plastic
  Straw, that it takes hundreds of years to decompose a single plastic product.
  Also, this infopoetry aims to show how this plastic waste is affecting the
  lives of the marine animals and destroying our planet. Every year millions of
  marine lives are killed by the disposal of waste into the oceans through
  various sources. And it needs to be heard & stopped.
