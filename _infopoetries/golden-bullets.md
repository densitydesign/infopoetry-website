  Iâ€™ve decided to use the bullet, as a small unit of violence and pain that
  becomes bigger as more money is spent. So, the medium selected is a well known
  object, an icon of the concept of war, a part for the whole thing (metonimy),
  even to make the difference between countries more physically and emotionally
  visible.

This infopoetry aims to emphasize how much money is spent to feed the military market, and which nations are spending the most. The bullet becomes a small unit of violence and pain that becomes bigger as more money is spent, connecting money with the concept of military supremacy.
