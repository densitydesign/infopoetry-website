  name: Words and sentences I would use to talk about myself. Images produced by
    Dall_E.
metaphor: "Imagine: you are posing for a portrait and the painter is blind.
  There is only one way to get your portrait: tell him about yourself. What do
  you choose to say when you talk about you?"
meaning: >-
  The project is a process of self-knowledge.

  In this case, however, the interlocutor is not another person but it’s a ‘blind’ and extraneous machine. The machine is not just a blind painter, it is a painter that has the knowledge of all the others painters within it. The resulting image is the synthesis of many others. A hermeneutic mechanism of knowledge and understan- ding of algorithmic language is therefore also involved in this process.

I told Runway, looking at my illustrations, to imitate me and then, looking at my inspirations, to do what I usually do, to imitate them to create a new illustration style. I put then one of my illustrations, an illustration I took inspiration from, and the two illustrations created by Runway, in a set of posters for a fictitious exposition, to show them in an hypothetically real situation and to make the observator reflect on the results.
