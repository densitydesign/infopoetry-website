My concept is an installation piece designed to interact with the general public. I placed multiple
transparent stickers of eyes with accompanying statistics about the surveillance of the general public
on bathroom mirrors and other transparent surfaces like windows. I took the data used for this
project from trusted source www.worldatlas.com for how many cameras there were in each city and
then used the population of each city to calculate how many cameras there are per person in the top
5 most surveilled cities in the world.
