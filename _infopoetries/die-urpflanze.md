metaphor: "Each picture represents a zone of different biological diversity
  according to a system of ten categories (Diversity Zones) that sorts world
  areas by vascular plants diversification. Data about DZs' linguistic diversity
  is conveyed by time of exposure, with each print varying in contrast and
  intensity from being exposed to sunlight for a time span proportional to
  corresponding language density. Botanical images, like languages, act as a
  vehicle to pass environmental knowledge and culture, enabling to show the
  direct correlation between the two worlds considered in the project and the
  emerging trend: the richer the cultures, the more the ways to know, represent
  and preserve the surrounding environment. The complete series metaphorically
  represents Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s imaginary primordial plant from which
  all plant forms originate, therefore containing in itself every possibility of
  variation."
meaning: Biodiversity preservation around the world is endangered by the lack of
  knowledge of local environment. The general trend towards increasing
  linguistic diversity in areas of increasing plant diversity highlights the
  mutual relationship that binds languages and the natural world and warns about
  how linguistic and cultural conservation is as fundamental as biodiversity’s.
  The project focuses on this particular aspect of the dataset and aims at
  investigating how cultural homologation can have a broader impact on different
  levels.

Intriguingly, patterns of language diversification resemble biodiversity’s ones, suggesting that similar mechanisms may underlie both. Die Urpflanze is a series of sunprints collected in a booklet providing a visualisation of how the so-called biocultural diversity is distributed globally.
