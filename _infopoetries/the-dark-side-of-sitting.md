metaphor: >-
  One could say it is about the dark side of sitting, the hidden dangers. On the
  other and, there is a materialistic side to the shadow, if one sits longer,
  the exposure difference on the wall will be bigger. In this way, the words
  exposure and shadow play together.
meaning: >-
  The core idea is to make people aware of the unhealthy effects of a chair.
  Therefore, the chair is portrait neutrally but it has a shadow that shows the
  true nature of the chair. The second idea is the physical effect of sitting to
  the body and to show the unhealthy pose that increases whilst the exposure to
  the chair is increasing.

Excessive sitting is extremely unhealthy, some even say that sitting is the new smoking. This project visualises the seated behaviour of different professions. How much people, on average, are exposed to sedentary behaviour is expressed by the strength of the shadow imprint left on the wall.
