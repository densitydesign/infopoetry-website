  name: Numbers and behaviors collected from my insulin pump injector and sensor
    attached to my arm which monitorates my glycemic levels 24h
metaphor: The metaphor wants to highlight the need of a device to have a normal
  life. My “data alterego” will accompany me through my journey showing the
  differences compared to a “healthy” life. The creation of “another me” with
  similar actions that a healthy person does.
meaning: I want to create awareness around the health issue topic. Showing the
  everyday life of a diabetic person, creating visual comparisons between what
  is called "normal life" and not. Through the datas the outcome will be able to
  empathize with the audience through a "game of layers" or "another digital
  me",  life that needs technology.

The "normality" according to health and culture standards are rarer than we think, what is normal for a diabetic? Is it the same of someone with no health issues? The visual storytelling of this projects wants to enlight the differences about perceptions. Through my everyday life  and my constant need of datas in order to conduct my "normal" life. The other digital me or what is called "atlas" not always has a negative meaning as is usual to be given when talking about datas. It's necessary for someone's life.
