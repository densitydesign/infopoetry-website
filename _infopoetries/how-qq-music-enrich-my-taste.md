  name: "QQ Music’s annual listening list: 50 most listened to singles one year
    before and one year after my arrival in Italy."
metaphor: The metaphor I choose is sandwich, because it is convenient as I can
  listen to music whenever and wherever, and also sandwich is rich mix and easy
  to see the taste as my listening tastes are very intuitively apparent from the
  song lists. I want to use the metaphor of a sandwich to show the algorithms
  behind the applications are like chefs to slowly change or enrich users’
  tastes.
meaning: My take on this problem is that algorithms have greatly accelerated the
  speed at which we are exposed to new things on the internet and enriched the
  content available to us. My design intention is to show people that the
  algorithms behind everyday software can accurately judge the user's
  environment and state and start to push accurately, and the algorithm is
  subtly changing people's daily life.

Nowadays, algorithms are increasingly involved in people’s daily lives and subtly change people’s behavior habits. By comparing the changes in music tastes before and after I came to Italy, I would like to talk about how algorithms can pinpoint users’ potential preferences based on a variety of personal data such as location, locale, browsing history of other software, etc., and then push a lot of relevant content and ultimately determine what kind of content to continue to push based on the user’s clickthrough feedback. Algorithms can change user behavior, albeit much faster.
