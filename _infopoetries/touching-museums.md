The Italian artistic heritage is very wide and precious, the reason why everyone should have the possibility to enjoy it. 
The project shows how many museums can give a real experience to the blind people, with tactile paths and reproduction of the art pieces with relief materials. The installation is made on purpose with a “language” that can be accessible for blind people, representing the museums with materials that are touch-sensitive and enhance the discrimination for the sight-disabled.
