My infopoetry is human space travel. The metaphor is FIREWORKS. One firework represents a space traveller in that mission. The colour of the fireworks symbolizes the colour of the national flag of the space traveller after the fireworks bloom, the darkness will be lighted up, symbolizing that every exploration of human beings will know more about space.
