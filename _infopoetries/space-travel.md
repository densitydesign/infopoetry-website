metaphor: >-
  One launch represents a mission. One firework represents a space traveller in
  that mission. The colour of the fireworks symbolizes the colour of the
  national flag of the space traveller. The speed of the fireworks and the time
  it stays represent the length of the space travel. The dark screen symbolizes
  the unknown universe, and there is a faint light at the bottom to symbolize
  earth. After the fireworks bloom, the darkness will be lighted up, symbolizing
  that every exploration of human beings will know more about space. And those
  people died in space will stay on screen and became a star.
