  name: Recording of six months of menstrual data
metaphor: A net is likened to my body, with each point symbolizing myself at
  that moment. The degree of distortion and change in the image is controlled by
  pressure, conveying pain and emotional change. The dramatic changes in the
  image are reminiscent of the pain and emotional breakdown the person is
  experiencing at the moment, giving the viewer room to imagine.
meaning: Menstruation, a physiological phenomenon that has been with girls for a
  long time, has always been something that is not easily mentioned in public,
  like a secret reserved for girls. But the pain and weakness that girls
  experience during menstruation is the most honest feedback from the body. I
  think women should be more positive about their body's feedback and pay
  attention to how they feel. I hope that through the interaction with the
  project, the audience can indirectly convey some "real feelings", so that they
  can appreciate the specificity of the female population.

The project is an interactive installation that connects the audience via pressure sensors. The viewer applies different amounts of pressure and the animated images controlled by the data change accordingly. The greater the pressure, the greater the distortion of the image, directly reflecting the ups and downs of my emotions and the level of physical pain.
