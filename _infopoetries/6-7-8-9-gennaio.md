This projects aim to show the dataset based on how much I spent to finish candies received January 6, the day of the celebration fo the epiphany. To represent the dataset, I created a stop motion video which funny describes how fast I ate the candies, besides my tastes in terms of sweet  that led me to leave last licorice and end up first strawberries
