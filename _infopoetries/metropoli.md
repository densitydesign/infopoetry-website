The emblematic game of capitalism is transformed into this visual representation of collected data which aims to address the growing problem of rents in Milan for students. The most important expenses of the flat are represented in the boxes, with corresponding cards describing the context of that expense, while in place of community chests and chances are personal expenses. The four players are the roommates and have in front of them money equivalent to their average monthly expenditure on Splitwise. Each box has a number of houses representing the percentage of the total average monthly expenditure to which that category corresponds.
