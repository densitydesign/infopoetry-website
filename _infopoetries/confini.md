The idea behind this project is to represent the boundaries between states that are not freely accessible; each roll of paper represents the length of a "rolled" border. To do this, the length in km was taken and converted into cm to make the project technically feasible. Rolling up the border makes it more tangible, making it easier to understand the impact it can have on certain people. The material used, paper, was chosen for a matter of practicality, as it is easily manipulated and economical. Each reel of paper is proportionally as long as it is along the border it represents, while for the height a common height of 7 cm has been chosen to facilitate comparison. For each border, a label was created with information on the date of construction, length, and separate countries.
