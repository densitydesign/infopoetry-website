  The infopoetry is presented as a small book (A6), similar to a dictionary,
  where the dataset is reported on semi-transparent pages, layering up according
  to the ‘distance’ of the categories from the original scientific term
  ‘menstruation’. The expressions belonging to the category considered the
  furthest from the definition are bigger and of a lighter shade of red, to
  facilitate the reader. The closer he moves toward the end, the readability
  decreases because of size and colour, becoming smaller and redder; a red
  independent paper facilitates the effect, constituting a layer useful to read
  and understand. On the last page, the definition of menstruation is
  practically unreadable, even when not covered by all the other layers.
meaning: >-
  The artwork aims to shed some light on the use of words, expressions and
  metaphors, that acquires here a double meaning. On one side the reader can
  appreciate the incredible creativity of the spoken language, in his beautiful
  shapeshifting and adaptability (a sort of meta-discussion on metaphors and
  their nature), while on the other he can reflect on how far the language can
  go in hiding a simple everyday topic, related to female anatomy, and how a
  taboo is hidden in plain sight, with the linguistic discrimination that brings
  along.
