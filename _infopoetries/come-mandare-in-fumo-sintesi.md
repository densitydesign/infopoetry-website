I have been a smoker for years, but this year I noticed that the number of cigarettes I smoked per day has increased. Among the causes that led me to increase the number of cigarettes, I used to smoke a day was certainly the Final Synthesis Laboratory. Assuming that my average number of cigarettes smoked per day is about ten, I wanted to represent the increase in the number of cigarettes lit during the entire course of the laboratory. It can be seen that there is an increase in conjunction with the deliveries of the Laboratory and the periods immediately prior to them. Among other things, just to think of this infopoetry I have already smoked 3 more.
