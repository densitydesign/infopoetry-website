Having a lot of space available generally corresponds to a rather high quality of life. Who would like to live in a square meter? The project visually and physically represents the minimum space available for animals in different situations, some more socially accepted than others. 'Breathing Spaces' in English can be understood both pragmatically as a living space, enough space to breathe, and figuratively as a chance to think, becoming a reference to the observer and inviting him to reflect. Two triptychs, one dedicated to male pigs over 110 kg fattening and one, Birthing spaces, dedicated to females with young in delivery rooms. Three different situations are represented: pigs in intensive rearing, organic rearing, and wild huntable pigs. The space is immediately visible and comparable thanks to proportionate holes, which allow us to identify with the animals and reflect on how much space is granted to them and their visual perception of the world.
