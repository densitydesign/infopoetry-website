The artifact includes 10 resumes, one of which is filled in in a "normal" manner, while for the other 9 each field has been filled in with the scientific name of Down's syndrome: Trisomy 21. The purpose of this artifact is to make people reflect on why, in 2013, very few people with Down syndrome still have a job.
