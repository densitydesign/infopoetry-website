  Taking the doll machine as a prototype, the grey dolls in the machine
  container waiting to be picked up by the hooks are metaphorized as other
  people participating in the bidding license plate. One of the marked
  significantly different doll is the participant itself. Each time the
  participant clicks on the Crawl button, the participants are enhanced with
  empathy and related experiences through changes in the process and different
  results in each crawl. 
meaning: >-
  The limited and scarce number of license plates is always unable to meet the
  needs of all the population. With the rise of China's new generation of the
  middle class, such as this phenomenon is very common in China. In current
  China, the guy having enough money does not solve all the problems. Sometimes
  luck, timing, and the conditions at the time determine what you can win. With
  the experience of this game console, foreigners (including Chinese) can
  understand why Chinese people need to work harder for a long time, make
  appropriate speculation, and keep some kind of social wisdom of Eastern
  philosophy to let the "hooks" of opportunities grab the doll machine.
