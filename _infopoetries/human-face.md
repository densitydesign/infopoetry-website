  name: Personal photos I shared on Instagram during the last 5 years.
metaphor: The image-to-text process replaces the overabundance of images of the
  original medium with the paradoxical absence of visual clues. The words,
  decontextualized and randomly scattered on the page, take the form of a
  concrete poem developed through an “uncreative” literary experiment.
meaning: The source of the data relates to the concept of digital identity and
  its relationship with the ego. The process is connected to employing
  algorithmic processes as new tools for creative/uncreative expression of our
  digitally mediated lives. Lastly, the medium refers to literary
  experimentalism and takes inspiration from "uncreative writing" practices.

"Human Face" is a book about a young adult's life or at least the part she decided to share on social media and publicly present herself with. Each page of the book represents a personal photo. Still, a computer vision algorithm has turned it into a typographic composition that scans the images and detects their content.
