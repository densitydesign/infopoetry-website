  Migrants bring with them water tanks during the migration journey, essential
  for their survivor. Here, each tank is representative of a region and is
  filled with sand as metaphor of the dryness. Higher is the level of the sand
  in the tank, more people moved and more the phenomenon was intense.
meaning: >-
  Water is a primary source that we can easily find, but in Somalia, millions of
  people are forced to move to search for it and save their lives. I want to
  make users reflect and develop more awareness about this relatively unknown
  topic giving them a comprehensive view of the phenomenon.

In Somalia, the drought-situation has created a huge internal migration pattern: 392.638 people were forced to move in the last two years. The installation shows how much the phenomenon affects the entire nation relating the number of migrants with their departure regions, from 2018 to October 2019.
