  name: Instagram ads information (Advertisers that showed ads in a period of one
    week on my Instagram).
metaphor: An hourglass is chosen as the metaphore because it can illustrate how
  our time on the app and in life is filled (like sand fills an hourglass), with
  marketing and distractions, that tell us that we need or want things that we
  really maybe don't need or want. This stuff is funnelled into our life.
meaning: Consumerism is a problem that is slowly rotting the world, and invading
  our lives, I think social media contributes in a big way to the issue, we're
  constantly being bombed by ads that try to push us to spend our money and time
  in goods and services that many times we don't even want or need, I want to
  express how social media tries to get us to waste our time in those
  unmeaningful things, almost as if they wanted to distract us from what we
  really want.
