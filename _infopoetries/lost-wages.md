metaphor: "The data was encoded via one of the most common products in the
  global garment industry: a set of T-Shirts."
meaning: "This infopoetry is dedicated to visualizing the consequences of
  Covid-19 pandemic on garment industry workers, by showing the wage gap
  percentage of millions of workers from the most productive countries. The
  concept stems from the desire to provoke and make people reflect on what is
  hidden behind the production of clothing that we usually buy and wear. From
  this message, follows the choice of metaphor and media through which to
  present it: a dystopian store similar in appearance to those we browse daily
  to buy our clothes, but where the products have a story to tell and are
  carriers of information relating to human exploitation."
