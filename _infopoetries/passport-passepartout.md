  name: Dataset extracted from LinkedIn.
metaphor: The comparison between my true anagrafic information and these
  deducted data will be encouraged by letting the visitors go through the pages
  of a replica of my passport and of my professional passport. The metaphor of
  the passport was also chosen because just as a preparation for a journey, one
  needs to prepare special documents in order to find work.
meaning: I hope to show the user that the online version of me is just a way I
  want to be perceived as, in the same way a passport describes you just
  phisically. It is one of many faces of the same individual, and this side is
  the one I share on Linkedin the most, being it the tool I use the most for job
  seeking. I want to also debate the journey of finding one’s own job in the
  digital area.

What is the combination of data that irrefutably distinguishes us? Profession is an element that is not only given importance in the drafting of documents, but also between people, being among the first things people say to each other. As the job search shifted to the internet, in order to stand out and leave my authentic mark,
I worked on a visual language that would best communicate the perception I aimed to convey. The concept of Brand Identity and that of “brand new” are intertwined in this project, with the creation of an ad hoc passport for the person LinkedIn sees me as, completing the profile with the assumptions it made based on the narrative
I used.
