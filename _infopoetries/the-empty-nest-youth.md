metaphor: >-
  The first thing that broke into my head was the bee's hive, which consisted of
  countless hexagons like a room, it is the best representative of the social
  culture and the external form of the group, both intuitive and artistic. 
meaning: >-
  Raising people's thinking about China's future social stability, young people
  redefine the meaning of marriage, the traditional family concept has been
  broken, and China has ushered in more social culture.

The total number of unmarried single-aged youths aged 25-39 in China in 2016, borrowing the metaphor of the hive, using special effects and appropriate music, giving people a strong visual experience and impact, thus realize the seriousness of this problem and cause new thinking.
