103780078	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acrocephalidae	Acrocephalus	luscinius	Guam Reed-warbler, Nightingale Reed-warbler	3.1	2016	This species qualifies as Extinct because of a very rapid rate of decline in its very small global population observed over the past three generations. It is likely that the introduced Brown Tree Snake Boiga irregularis delivered the final blow to the species following significant habitat loss from wetland drainage and increased frequency in fires, potential impacts from pesticides and impacts of a variety of additional introduced species (Reichel et al.1992, Kennerley and Pearson 2010).	Several factors in combination are likely to have caused the species's extirpation, including wetland destruction, predation by the introduced Brown Tree Snake (Boiga irregularis), pesticide-use and major fires.
22735592	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acrocephalidae	Acrocephalus	musae	Leeward Islands Reed Warbler	3.1	2016		The introduction of feral cats Felis catus, rats Rattus spp. (A. Gouni in litt. 2012) and many alien bird species, including the aggressive Common Myna Acridotheres tristis, may have contributed to its extinction (Thibault 1988, Seitre and Seitre 1991).
103780109	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acrocephalidae	Acrocephalus	nijoi	Aguijan Reed-warbler	3.1	2016		Introduced predators, including feral cats (Felis catus) and rats (Rattus spp.), and possibly monitor lizard (Varanus indicus), may have been a large factor in the declines, or possibly the impact of Ivy Gourd Coccinia grandis (USFWS 1998, Mosher 2006).
62184893	Chordata	Aves	Strigiformes	Strigidae	Aegolius	gradyi	Bermuda Saw-whet Owl	3.1	2016		The cause of extinction is unknown, but may have been driven by the decline of native cedar and palmetto trees following human colonisation, along with the arrival of alien predators and competitors (Olson 2012).
103823212	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Akialoa	ellisiana	Oahu Akialoa	3.1	2016	This species was found in the Hawaiian Islands, USA, but it is now Extinct as a result of forest clearance and introduced disease. The last report was of the subspecies stejnegeri on Kaua'i in 1969.	
103823431	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Akialoa	lanaiensis	Lanai Akialoa	3.1	2016		All three subspecies are thought to have been driven to extinction by habitat destruction and disease (Collar et al. 1994). Introduced predators and hurricane damage are likely to have also been important on Kaua'i (Woodworth et al. 2009).
22728910	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Akialoa	obscura	Hawaii Akialoa	3.1	2016		Its extinction was probably because of deforestation and introduced disease-carrying mosquitoes which are prevalent in the lowlands (Collar et al. 1994).
103823250	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Akialoa	stejnegeri	Kauai Akialoa	3.1	2016		All three subspecies are thought to have been driven to extinction by habitat destruction and disease (Collar et al. 1994). Introduced predators and hurricane damage are likely to have also been important on Kaua'i (Woodworth et al. 2009).
787	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Alburnus	akili	Beysehir Bleak	3.1	2014	This species was endemic to Lake Beysehir in Turkey. The species declined after the introduction of Pikeperch into the lake in 1955. Overfishing also contributed to declines. It is now Extinct.	
19018670	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Alburnus	nicaeensis	Iznik Shemaya	3.1	2014	The species was only known from Lake Iznik basin, Turkey. This species has not been found since the late 20th century despite several intensive studies on Lake Iznik (1996-2003), the only known habitat of this species. The species is now Extinct most likely due to alien species invasion which were stocked into the lake to improve fisheries yields.	
22691601	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Alectroenas	nitidissimus	Mauritius Blue-pigeon	3.1	2016	This species was found on Mauritius, but it has been hunted to extinction. The last reports date from 1832 and it is thought to have been Extinct a few years later.	
62759683	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Alectroenas	payandeei	Rodrigues Blue-pigeon	3.1	2016		The island was used as a refurbishment station for shipping from at least 1601, presumably leading to the arrival of rats, which were noted to be present in large numbers in 1691-1693 (Leguat 1708, in Hume and Walters 2012) and likely drove the species to extinction.
44579175	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Scincidae	Alinea	luciae	Saint Lucia Skink	3.1	2016	Listed as Extinct on the basis that this species is not known to survive either on Saint Lucia or on any of its satellites, all of which have been well-surveyed over many years, with the likely agent of its extinction being the introduction of mongoose and rats roughly contemporary with the known specimens. Although skinks elsewhere in the Caribbean have been found to survive on small mongoose-free islands, there is no reasonable prospect that this large skink could have survived on Saint Lucia's satellites, which have been subject to intensive work and which represent the only remaining refugia for another lizard species lost from the Saint Lucia mainland. While the continued survival of a remote mainland population cannot be completely ruled out, this island has been subject to sufficiently intensive herpetological survey work that there is thought to be no reasonable doubt that this species is extinct.	
22691052	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Alopecoenas	ferrugineus	Tanna Ground-Dove	3.1	2016	This species is known from Tanna, Vanuatu, but the only record dates from 1774 and it is now Extinct. Hunting is likely to have been the main cause.	It is likely to have become extinct because of hunting and the depredations of human commensals.
22691056	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Alopecoenas	salamonis	Thick-billed Ground Dove	3.1	2016	This species was known from Makira, Solomon Islands, but is now Extinct as a result of predation by introduced species. The last record is a specimen dating from 1927, and searches in 1995 and more recently failed to find it.	The species is likely to have declined through a combination of predation by introduced cats and rats, and habitat destruction. On Makira, introduced rats, pigs, cats and dogs are widespread. Most lowland forest has been logged or is in logging concessions, and the larger pigeons are targeted by local hunters. Ramos remains forested and appears to be free of introduced predators, although hunters from the adjacent islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita make regular journeys to harvest the nesting Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica, and may have shot ground-doves on these expeditions (Buckingham et al. 1995, G. Dutson pers. obs. 1998, D. Gibbs in litt. 1999).
22729490	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Alopochen	kervazoi	Reunion Shelduck	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of Réunion, but is now Extinct. The last record came from 1671-1672, and it had been lost to hunting by 1710.	As early as 1667 Martin recorded destruction of the wildfowl and habitat of the Etang de Saint-Paul, and similar processes are likely to have led to its extinction throughout the island.
22728658	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Alopochen	mauritiana	Mauritius Shelduck	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to Mauritius, but is now Extinct. It was last recorded in 1693, when it was said to be rare, and could not be found in 1698. Hunting is thought to have caused its extinction.	"It was presumably heavily hunted because it was described as ""not large, but fat and good""."
22728705	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Amazona	martinicana	Martinique Amazon, Martinique Parrot	3.1	2016	This species formerly occurred on Martinique, but it has been driven to extinction by hunting. The last record dates from 1779 and it is thought to have gone Extinct by the end of the 18th century.	Hunting is likely to have caused its extinction.
22728701	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Amazona	violacea	Guadeloupe Amazon, Guadeloupe Parrot	3.1	2016	This species was known from Guadeloupe, but it has been driven Extinct by hunting. The last records date from 1779.	It was heavily hunted, and this presumably caused its extinction.
166049	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Anabarilius	macrolepis		3.1	2011		The water level of the lake declined since the 1950s. In 1981 the lake completely dried up (for about 20 days) as a result of water abstraction for agriculture. The lake is also polluted by increased organic pollution caused by sedimentation from the surrounding catchment.
22728666	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Anas	marecula	Amsterdam Island Duck	3.1	2016		It was presumably hunted to extinction by whalers stopping off on the island (Olson and Jouventin 1996).
22728662	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Anas	theodori	Mauritius Duck	3.1	2016	This species was found on Mauritius, but is now Extinct having not been recorded since 1696. Hunting is likely to have caused its extinction.	It was presumably hunted to extinction.
22728814	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Meliphagidae	Anthornis	melanocephala	Chatham Island Bellbird	3.1	2016	This species was found in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, but it is now Extinct, probably mainly as a result of habitat loss. It was last recorded in 1906, and a search for it in 1938 was unsuccessful.	The reasons for its decline are obscure, but were probably a combination of habitat destruction, predation by introduced rats and cats (Greenway 1967), and over-collection for the museum trade (Oliver 1955).
22728884	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Aphanapteryx	bonasia	Red Rail	3.1	2016	This species was known from Mauritius, but went Extinct around 1693 due to cat predation and hunting.	It was flightless and palatable and therefore was presumably hunted to extinction (Cheke 1987), although introduced cats are also likely to have taken some birds.
1848	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Cyprinodontidae	Aphanius	splendens	Gölçük Toothcarp	3.1	2014		The species vanished due to alien species invasion. Alien species were stocked to improve fisheries.
61225	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Poeciliidae	Aplocheilichthys	sp. nov. 'Naivasha'		3.1	2004		Competition and predation by introduced species may have led to the extinction of this species.
22710496	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Sturnidae	Aplonis	corvina	Kosrae Starling	3.1	2016	This species was known from the island of Kosrae, Micronesia, but it is now Extinct due to overpredation by introduced rats. The last specimens were taken in 1828, and it was absent when the island was next visited in 1880.	Its extinction was presumably a result of depredation by introduced rats, which were accidentally introduced by whalers and are abundant on the island.
22710511	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Sturnidae	Aplonis	fusca	Norfolk Starling, Tasman Starling	3.1	2016		The extinction of the Lord Howe Island population was probably due to the arrival of black rat Rattus rattus on the island in 1918. The reasons for the extinction of the Norfolk Island population are less clear cut because R. rattus did not reach the island until the 1940s. It may have become extinct as a result of habitat destruction (Garnett 1993). If it did persist undocumented until the 1940s, rats would have most likely played a part in its extinction (Garnett et al. 2011).
22710499	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Sturnidae	Aplonis	mavornata	Mysterious Starling	3.1	2016	This taxon was known from Mauke, Cook Islands, but it is now Extinct due to overpredation by introduced brown rats. The type specimen was taken in 1825, and the species was not found on the next ornithological visit to Mauke in 1975.	
22734867	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Sturnidae	Aplonis	ulietensis	Raiatea Starling, Bay Thrush, Bay Starling	3.1	2016	This Extinct species is known only from a 1774 painting of the type specimen, contemporary descriptions and a few field notes. It occurred on Raiatea (French Polynesia).	It is assumed that the arrival of introduced species such as rats were the cause of the extinction of the species.
22724513	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Ara	tricolor	Cuban Macaw	3.1	2016		Its extinction was caused by hunting for food and felling of nesting trees to capture young birds for pets (Forshaw and Cooper 1989).
54518	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Bufonidae	Atelopus	ignescens	Quito Stubfoot Toad, Jambato Toad	3.1	2004		It probably disappeared due to the synergistic effects of the disease chytridiomycosis-confirmed in this species-and climatic change (local warming and droughts). Habitat loss and the introduction of predatory non-native trout might also have contributed to some population declines, however these threats are unlikely to have caused the substantial decline of the species throughout its range.
54522	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Bufonidae	Atelopus	longirostris	Longnose Stubfoot Toad, Scrawny Stubfoot-toad	3.1	2004		The decline in Ecuador is unexplained, and is possibly due to the disease chytridiomycosis, although this seems unusual given that the species was also found at lower elevations where chytridiomycosis is often not considered to be a threat. Other possible factors contributing to the extinction of this species include general climate change, pollution and habitat loss.
54561	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Bufonidae	Atelopus	vogli		3.1	2004		The species is believed to have become extinct following the extensive conversion of its habitat to agricultural use.
22728754	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Atlantisia	podarces	St Helena Crake	3.1	2016		It was large and flightless, and therefore probably hunted to extinction by humans and introduced predators.
61247	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Barbus	microbarbis		3.1	2016		Introduction of Tilapia and Haplochromis species led to the extinction of the species in Lake Luhondo (De Vos et al. 1990).
62183030	Chordata	Aves	Accipitriformes	Accipitridae	Bermuteo	avivorus	Bermuda Hawk	3.1	2016		The cause of extinction is unknown, but may have been a combination of hunting for food and the introduction of feral pigs and other animals.
71510353	Chordata	Mammalia	Diprotodontia	Potoroidae	Bettongia	anhydra	Desert Bettong	3.1	2016		The Desert Bettong was probably driven to extinction because of predation by introduced Red Foxes and feral domestic cats, perhaps combined with inappropriate fire regimes.There is strong evidence for decline and extinction of critical weight range mammals due to predation by Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes); Short (1998) documented a close correlation between the extinction of bettongs in New South Wales and the arrival of the Red Fox.There is strong evidence for decline and extinction of desert critical weight range mammals due to predation by feral domestic cats; attempts to reintroduce Boodies B. lesueur to mainland areas where Red Foxes were controlled failed because of predation by feral cats (Christensen and Burrows 1994).When Aboriginal people moved to settlements, fire regimes in the western deserts changed from mostly small fires resulting in a mosaic of fire ages to one of infrequent, very large summer fires (Latz 1995), with consequences for food availability and habitat suitability demonstrated for small desert macropods (Bolton and Latz 1978).
136721	Chordata	Mammalia	Cetartiodactyla	Bovidae	Bos	primigenius	Aurochs	3.1	2008		In central Poland in the forests of the village of Jaktorow for several centuries the managed of the remaining aurochs was well organised. Initially the animals were owned by nobility, but later they became royal possessions. There they were protected and fed during the winter period. However, the Kings Zygmunt I and his successor Zygmunt August had less interest than their predecessors and did little to preserve the animals, and the conservation measures weakened. After 1572, a period of political turmoil lead to a decrease in influence of the King. By 1604 only a few aurochs remained, and a Royal decree was issued stating that everything needed to be done to protect the aurochs and its habitat, but this was not enough (Van Vuure, 2003). The species disappeared because of hunting and competition on its feeding grounds with domesticated cattle (The Extinction Website, 2007). The last aurochs in Poland disappeared through a combination of lack of interest, corruption, cattle diseases, food competition (from domesticated cattle), and to a lesser extent, hunting (Van Vuure, 2003).
3121	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Echimyidae	Brotomys	voratus	Hispaniolan Edible Rat	3.1	2016		Driven to extinction by introduced rats. Was hunted by Arawak Indians prior to European arrival.
22728804	Chordata	Aves	Procellariiformes	Procellariidae	Bulweria	bifax	Small St Helena Petrel, St. Helena Bulwer's Petrel	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of St Helena, but is thought to have been hunted to extinction shortly after the island's discovery in 1502.	Predation by people and introduced predators is likely to have driven it to extinction.
155997	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Bythinella	gibbosa		3.1	2010		The species was recorded from springs in the small villages adjacent to Toulouse in the 1850-1860's, however these locations are now all part of the city of Toulouse, and the sites are believed to have been lost during urbanisation.
22728873	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Cabalus	modestus	Chatham Rail, Chatham Islands Rail, Chatham Island Rail	3.1	2016		Its extinction was presumably caused by predation by rats and cats (which were introduced in the 1890s), habitat destruction to provide sheep pasture (which destroyed all of the island's bush and tussock grass by 1900), and from grazing by goats and rabbits (Marchant and Higgins 1993). On Chatham and Pitt Islands Olson (1975c) has suggested that its extinction resulted from competition with the larger Dieffenbach's Rail Gallirallus dieffenbachii (also extinct), but the two species have been shown to have been sympatric on Mangere (Tennyson and Millener 1994).
3626	Chordata	Mammalia	Diprotodontia	Potoroidae	Caloprymnus	campestris	Desert Rat Kangaroo, Plains Rat-kangaroo, Buff-nosed Rat-kangaroo, Desert Rat-kangaroo	3.1	2016		Extinction is considered to have been due to predation by red foxes and feral cats. Habitat degradation by introduced herbivores may have contributed to the extinction.
153825	Arthropoda	Malacostraca	Decapoda	Cambaridae	Cambarellus	alvarezi		3.1	2010		The pond habitat of this species is thought to have been relatively stable between 1960 and 1989 (Rodriguez and Campos 1994). However, since then, intensive pumping of groundwater for agriculture has led to a dramatic reduction in the size of the pond and the amount of aquatic vegetation that it supports (Rodriguez and Campos 1994, Contreras-Balderas and Lozano-Vilano 1996). Furthermore, this location is now known to be completely dry, confirmed in 2006 and 2009 (C. Pedraza-Lara pers. comm. 2010).
153621	Arthropoda	Malacostraca	Decapoda	Cambaridae	Cambarellus	chihuahuae		3.1	2010		Ojo de Carbonera spring is threatened by increased pumping of groundwater for irrigation, which has already resulted in the failure of other spring flows in nearby areas (Echelle et al. 2003). An increased level of desiccation has also been reported from the area once occupied by this species (C. Pedraza-Lara pers. comm. 2010). This seems to have led to the complete desiccation of most, if not all, of the springs which formerly supported populations of this species (F. Alvarez pers. comm. 2010), while the agricultural industry responsible for this water abstraction has now collapsed in the area owing to a lack of groundwater.
22680418	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Camptorhynchus	labradorius	Labrador Duck	3.1	2016		Shooting and trapping on the winter quarters were certainly proximate factors in the species's extinction. Overharvest of birds and eggs on the breeding grounds could also have been a factor (Chilton 1997), and it is likely that ecosystem-level effects following the arrival of Europeans reduced the supply of available food (Gourdin 2009).
22728892	Chordata	Aves	Falconiformes	Falconidae	Caracara	lutosa	Guadalupe Caracara	3.1	2016		The island was once heavily vegetated, but grazing by goats has almost entirely denuded it (Jehl 1983). However, the primary cause of the species's decline was direct persecution by settlers (Greenway 1967).
22720622	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Carpodacus	ferreorostris	Bonin Grosbeak	3.1	2016		It seems reasonable to surmise from its ecology that its extinction resulted from the deforestation of the islands, and the introduction of cats and rats (Stattersfield et al. 1998).
4097	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Anguidae	Celestus	occiduus	Jamaica Giant Galliwasp, Sinking Galliwasp	2.3	1996	Last recorded in 1840, it is thought that the introduction of predatory species (e.g., mongooses) to Jamaica resulted in the extinction of Celestus occiduus.	The introduction of predatory species (e.g., mongooses) may have resulted in the extinction of the Jamaica Giant Galliwasp.
196771	Arthropoda	Arachnida	Opiliones	Podoctidae	Centrobunus	braueri		3.1	2014		This species was threatened by habitat deterioration due to the effects of invasive plant species, especially the tree Cinnaomomum verum. Since the species was last recorded in 1894 habitat degradation has been severe on Mahe and as a result the remaining area of relatively healthy habitat is extremely small.
4322	Chordata	Mammalia	Peramelemorphia	Chaeropodidae	Chaeropus	ecaudatus	Pig-footed Bandicoot	3.1	2016		The extinction of the Pig-footed Bandicoot is attributed to predation by feral cats and red foxes. The impact of exotic disease is unknown, but possible. Habitat degradation by introduced stock would have occurred in some, minor parts of the former range.
22704348	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Mohoidae	Chaetoptila	angustipluma	Kioea	3.1	2016		Deforestation, hunting and introduced predators are likely to have contributed to this species's extinction.
184510	Mollusca	Bivalvia	Unionoida	Iridinidae	Chambardia	letourneuxi		3.1	2010		Aquatic pollution threatens this species.
9017	Chordata	Reptilia	Testudines	Testudinidae	Chelonoidis	abingdonii	Pinta Giant Tortoise, Abingdon Island Tortoise	3.1	2016	With the death of the last known Pinta Tortoise, Lonesome George (in captivity since 1972), on 24 June 2012, the species went extinct. Extensive surveys have failed to find other tortoises on Pinta or in any of the world's zoos. Tortoises with up to 50% abingdonii genes have been reported from Volcan Wolf on northern Isabela, including first generation hybrids, but no pure individuals of abingdonii are known to exist (TEWG, 2015). This assessment incorporates contributions from the international workshop on Galapagos tortoises convened by the Galapagos National Park Directorate in July 2012.	Chelonoidis abingdonii was heavily exploited by whalers and other mariners in the 19th century as on-board food supplies, which severely depleted the population. By the 20th century, few tortoises remained and some exploitation continued by local fishermen. In addition, extensive deforestation by goats, introduced to Pinta in 1959, destroyed tortoise habitat (Pritchard 1996).
62239833	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Chenonetta	finschi	Finsch's Duck	3.1	2016		It may have become reduced in range and population before human settlement. Extinction occurred after Polynesian settlement but there is uncertainty whether the species persisted into European times. It was probably extremely vulnerable to egg predation by Polynesian rats Rattus exulans, and was hunted by early Maori. Rats may have also competed for food. It is unclear what impact habitat modification would have had on the species (Adams 2013).
4639	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Subulinidae	Chilonopsis	nonpareil	Great Saint Helena Awl Snail	3.1	2014		A live specimen of this species has never been found; the only records are pre-1875 and are of sub-fossil shells. While there is no documentary evidence on the causes of decline it is probable that this species was severely impacted by extensive habitat modification by goats, pigs and rabbits; while the goats and pigs have been removed rabbits are still present. It is also possible that direct predation by invasive non-native species such as rats, mice and the large, aggressive centipede Scolopendra morsitans Linnaeus, 1758 added to the pressure on this species.
13152363	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Scincidae	Chioninia	coctei	Cape Verde Giant Skink, Bibron's Skink, Cocteau's Lizard	3.1	2013		Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone 2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.
22728825	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Chloridops	kona	Kona Grosbeak, Grosbeak Finch	3.1	2016	This species was known from the Hawaiian island of Lana'i, USA, but it has not been recorded since 1894 and is now Extinct. Logging of its forest habitat coupled with the impacts of introduced predators is likely to have caused the loss of this species.	
22687333	Chordata	Aves	Caprimulgiformes	Trochilidae	Chlorostilbon	bracei	Brace's Emerald	3.1	2016	This species is known from the island of New Providence, Bahamas, but has been driven to extinction by human disturbance. A specimen was taken in 1877 and it was probably Extinct soon afterwards: subsequent collectors found no trace of it.	
22728709	Chordata	Aves	Caprimulgiformes	Trochilidae	Chlorostilbon	elegans	Caribbean Emerald	3.1	2016		Reasons for its extinction are difficult to infer, though the extinction of its preferred food plants or habitat through deforestation, or predation by introduced mammals may be responsible.
22720840	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Ciridops	anna	Ula-ai-hawane, Ula-'ai-hawane	3.1	2016	This species is known from Hawaii's Big Island, USA, but it is now Extinct due to logging of its forest habitat. The last confirmed records date from 1892.	Nothing is known about the causes of its extinction (Greenway 1967), although deforestation and avian malaria are likely to have been contributing factors. Habitat change may have exposed the population to unusually high numbers of rats (W.E. Banko and P.C. Banko 2009).
62178398	Chordata	Aves	Charadriiformes	Scolopacidae	Coenocorypha	barrierensis	North Island Snipe	3.1	2016	This species was extirpated from its historic range by introduced mammalian predators; it was last recorded in 1870 and is classified as Extinct.	The introduction of Pacific rats and feral cats presumably brought about the extinction of this species.
22727515	Chordata	Aves	Charadriiformes	Scolopacidae	Coenocorypha	iredalei	South Island Snipe	3.1	2016	This species has been extirpated from its historic range by introduced mammalian predators; it was last recorded in 1964 and is classified as Extinct.	Many local extinctions have occurred in the past, probably caused by various introductions of Pacific rat Rattus exulans, cats, pigs and Weka Gallirallus australis (Higgins and Davies 1996). The accidental introduction of black rats Rattus rattus onto Stewart Island in 1964 presumably brought about the extinction of C. iredalei.
62322970	Chordata	Aves	Piciformes	Picidae	Colaptes	oceanicus	Bermuda Flicker	3.1	2016		The cause of extinction is unknown, but may have been driven by the decline of native cedar and palmetto trees following human colonisation, along with the arrival of alien predators and competitors.
62254534	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Columba	thiriouxi	Mauritius Woodpigeon	3.1	2016		This species was apparently easily caught, and probably became extinct as a result of overhunting, predation by Black Rats, and deforestation (Hume and Walters 2012).
22690218	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Columba	versicolor	Bonin Woodpigeon, Bonin Wood-Pigeon	3.1	2016		Its extinction presumably resulted from clearance of the islands' subtropical evergreen forest, and from predation by introduced cats and rats (Stattersfield et al. 1998).
5223	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Conilurus	albipes	White-footed Rabbit-rat	3.1	2016		Previously very common and widespread, this species declined to extinction very rapidly with decline occurring across a wide range of habitats, in areas transformed by expanding pastoralism and spread of rabbits, and in areas without such modification. The primary cause of decline was probably predation by feral cats, but resource depletion and habitat change due to clearing, livestock, changed fire regimes and rabbits may have contributed to the decline in some areas (Woinarski et al. 2014).
75927841	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Conilurus	capricornensis	Capricorn Rabbit-rat	3.1	2016		This species has never been recorded alive, so assessment of threats is speculative. It was probably affected by the same threats that contributed to the extinction of Conilurus albipes - most likely predation by feral cats, but also reduction in food resources and habitat quality due to spread of pastoralism, clearing and changes in fire regime.
63488699	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Teiidae	Contomastix	charrua		3.1	2016		It seems likely that the increasing human settlement of Cabo Polonio by people, with an attendant increase in the numbers of predatory dogs and cats, and massive tourism, particularly during the summer months (the lizards's reproductive season) could have caused its extinction (Cabrera and Carreira 2009).
22685776	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Conuropsis	carolinensis	Carolina Parakeet	3.1	2016		The main causes of the species's extinction were persecution (for food, crop protection, aviculture and the millinery trade), and deforestation (especially of the bottomlands), probably compounded by its gregarious nature (Saikku 1991), and by competition with introduced bees (McKinley 1960).
47102774	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Scincidae	Copeoglossum	redondae	Redonda Skink	3.1	2016		It is likely that black rats preyed on this terrestrial lizard (Hedges and Conn 2012), and it may have been reliant to some degree on native vegetation, invertebrates and litter structure which has now been lost. Almost no vegetation remains on Redonda due to overgrazing by goats. Given this, the failure of multiple targeted surveys to record it, and the apparent sensitivity of skinks on Caribbean islands - many of which have drastically declined or been lost following mammal introductions - Copeoglossum redondae is presumed to be extinct.
135627	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Salmoniformes	Salmonidae	Coregonus	fera		3.1	2008		The reasons for the extinction are thought to be eutrophication and overfishing in the early 1900s.
135506	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Salmoniformes	Salmonidae	Coregonus	gutturosus		3.1	2008		Eutrophication which peaked in 1979. Natural reproduction in coregonids is said to have almost stopped during the period of high eutrophication as the eggs could no longer develop in the low-oxygen substrates.
135671	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Salmoniformes	Salmonidae	Coregonus	hiemalis		3.1	2008		The reasons for the extinction are thought to be eutrophication and overfishing in the early 1900s.
5371	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Salmoniformes	Salmonidae	Coregonus	nigripinnis	Blackfin Cisco	2.3	1996	Formerly occurred in the Great Lakes, where it is now extinct; last known specimens were taken from Lake Huron in 1923 and from Lake Michigan in 1969. The decline and extinction of this species was due to overfishing, sea lamprey predation, and introgressive hybridization.	
135570	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Salmoniformes	Salmonidae	Coregonus	restrictus		3.1	2008		Eutrophication which happened before 1950s.
5438	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Scorpaeniformes	Cottidae	Cottus	echinatus	Utah Lake Sculpin	3.1	2013		Decreased water quality associated with agriculture, introduced fishes, and drought-associated low lake levels in 1930s may have led to extinction (Lee et al. 1980, Miller et al. 1989).
22678955	Chordata	Aves	Galliformes	Phasianidae	Coturnix	novaezelandiae	New Zealand Quail 	3.1	2016	This species formerly occurred on New Zealand's South Island, but is now Extinct, probably due to diseases spread by introduced game birds. A bird that died in 1875 is thought to represent the last individual of the species.	
22684143	Chordata	Aves	Cuculiformes	Cuculidae	Coua	delalandei	Snail-eating Coua, Delalande's Coua	3.1	2016		The complete deforestation of Ile de Sainte-Marie was presumably the ultimate cause of its extinction (Goodman 1993). Snaring for feathers and food and predation by introduced rats may also have contributed to the species's demise (Collar et al. 1994).
56513	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Craugastoridae	Craugastor	chrysozetetes	McCranie's Robber Frog	3.1	2004		The species is believed to have disappeared through a combination of threats including deforestation resulting from agricultural encroachment, human settlement of the region, logging, fires and landslides. The area from which this species was recorded is subject to extensive landslides; these often severely impact the species habitat. It should be additionally noted that all streamside Craugastor above 900m asl have disappeared in Honduras in a manner that is consistent with the disease chytridiomycosis.
56588	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Craugastoridae	Craugastor	escoces	Heredia Robber Frog	3.1	2004		The most likely cause of its disappearance in suitable habitats is the disease chytridiomycosis, perhaps in combination with climate change or other, unknown, factors.
41320	Chordata	Mammalia	Didelphimorphia	Didelphidae	Cryptonanus	ignitus	Red-bellied Gracile Mouse Opossum	3.1	2016		The major threats to this species, which are presumed to have driven it to extinction, are the human impact of agricultural and technological development, cattle ranching, and deforestation (Daz et al. 2002).
22728673	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Cyanoramphus	ulietanus	Raiatea Parakeet	3.1	2016	This species was known from the island of Raiatea, French Polynesia, but it is now Extinct, probably as a result of habitat clearance or the action of invasive species. Two specimens were collected in 1773 and its extinction likely followed.	Its extinction was probably the result of the clearance of the islands' forests, hunting, or predation by introduced species (Forshaw and Cooper 1989).
22685182	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Cyanoramphus	zealandicus	Black-fronted Parakeet	3.1	2016		Its demise could have resulted from habitat loss, hunting or predation by introduced species (Forshaw and Cooper 1989).
173001	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Iguanidae	Cyclura	onchiopsis	Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana, Navassa Iguana, Navassa Island Iguana, Navassa Rock Iguana	3.1	2011		Like other rock iguanas, the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana was probably threatened by non-native predators, hunting for human consumption, and non-native competitors which destroyed the vegetation. Schwartz and Carey (1977) suggested that the introduction of goats and/or cats by the lighthouse keepers might have been responsible for its extinction, but Powell (1999) indicated that exploitation by mine workers on the island during the latter half of the 19th century was a more probable explanation.
202375	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Cyprinodontidae	Cyprinodon	arcuatus	Santa Cruz Pupfish	3.1	2013		This species was a victim of water depletion caused by increasing aridity, channel incision (arroyo cutting), groundwater pumping for irrigation, and flow diversion for domestic use (Minckley et al. 2002). Monkey Spring (the occupied habitat) was altered into a pond and canal about a century ago. Extirpation occurred in the late 1960s during the repair and modification of an irrigation system fed by Monkey Spring, combined with predation resulting from unauthorized introduction of largemouth bass (Minckley and Marsh 2009).
6179	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Cyprinus	yilongensis		3.1	2011		Overfishing depleted populations of the species. The water level of the lake declined since the 1950s. In 1981 the lake completely dried up (for about 20 days) as a result of water abstraction for agriculture. The lake is also polluted by increased organic pollution caused by sedimentation from the surrounding catchment. Urbanisation and pollution from agriculture are also threats.
22733394	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Diaphorapteryx	hawkinsi	Hawkins's Rail	3.1	2016		Its remains are frequently associated with middens of the islands' initial Polynesian inhabitants, the Moriori, indicating that hunting is likely to have caused its extinction.
201462	Arthropoda	Arachnida	Holothyroidae	Holothyridae	Dicrogonatus	gardineri	Gardiner's Giant Mite	3.1	2014		This species was threatened by habitat deterioration caused by invasion of introduced tree species, principally Cinnamomum verum.
22720852	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Drepanis	funerea	Black Mamo	3.1	2016		Its extinction was probably largely caused by the destruction of its understorey habitat by introduced cattle and deer, and predation by rats and mongooses (Greenway 1967).
22720848	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Drepanis	pacifica	Hawaii Mamo	3.1	2016		It was heavily trapped by Hawaiians for its feathers (Rose et al. 1993), but it is more likely that habitat destruction and disease were the ultimate causes of the species's extinction (Greenway 1967).
22724449	Chordata	Aves	Struthioniformes	Casuariidae	Dromaius	baudinianus	Kangaroo Island Emu	3.1	2016		The species was apparently systematically hunted to extinction by a settler (Howchin 1926), although habitat alteration by fire may also have contributed to its demise (Marchant and Higgins 1991).
22728643	Chordata	Aves	Struthioniformes	Casuariidae	Dromaius	minor	King Island Emu	3.1	2016		Its extinction was presumably a result of being hunted by sealers for food (Marchant and Higgins 1991).
62258591	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Dryolimnas	augusti	Reunion Rail	3.1	2016	This recently-described, probably flightless rail was likely driven Extinct in the late 17th century as a result of hunting pressure and predation by introduced rats and cats.	Presumably driven extinct by over-hunting, and predation by introduced rats and cats (Hume and Walters 2012).
6862	Arthropoda	Insecta	Coleoptera	Curculionidae	Dryophthorus	distinguendus		3.1	2014		The species is thought to be extinct. It was reported to be common in 1926 but has not been recorded since 1961. The threats it faced have not been identified but probably included habitat degradation and invasive species.
6923	Chordata	Mammalia	Carnivora	Canidae	Dusicyon	australis	Falklands Wolf	3.1	2015		The species was hunted by Argentine settlers in early 1800s, and by US fur traders in the 1830s. Due to being tame and curious and unafraid of humans, it was particularly susceptible to culling. Scottish settlers and their sheep flocks arrived in the 1860s and considered D. australis a pest and a threat to their sheep, setting fire to brushwood and laying out poison baits.
82337482	Chordata	Mammalia	Carnivora	Canidae	Dusicyon	avus		3.1	2015		The demise of the species has been linked to habitat changes, hybridization with dogs and persecution. The abundant fossils of Dusicyon avus show a clear archaeological and temporal overlap with modern humans. A specimen was discovered in a grave from the late second millennium BC, suggesting that the animal might have been kept as a pet (Prates 2014); the teeth of Dusicyon avus were used in a religions context in some aboriginal sites of Buenos Aires province. According to new radiocarbon evidence, the species would have become extinct about 326-496 years BP (Prevosti et al. 2015), supporting the hypothesis that its disappearance might have happened after the arrival of Europeans. Anecdotal evidence exists from the diaries of 19th century naturalists and explorers of a large canid in Patagonia attributable to Dusicyon avus. Prevosti et al. (2015) found no evidence for hybridization, and proposed that the drivers of the recent extinction of the species were anthropogenic impacts, including hunting and domestic dogs, coupled with climatic change. The indigenous Ona of Tierra del Fuego recognized two species of fox, one of a large size.
22720738	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Dysmorodrepanis	munroi	Lanai Hookbill	3.1	2016		Much of Lana`i was cleared for pineapple plantations in the 1910s, and this, along with predation by cats and rats, presumably drove the species to extinction (Snetsinger et al. 1998).
62307504	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Eclectus	infectus	Oceanic Parrot	3.1	2016	This recently-described parrot may have survived as recently as the late 18th century, but became Extinct most likely as a result of over-hunting and predation by invasive mammals.	
22690733	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Ectopistes	migratorius	Passenger Pigeon	3.1	2016		The precise cause of its extinction is difficult to determine, but the widespread clearance of the hardwood trees which provided its mast food, and the proliferation of the rail network and telegraph system which enabled efficient location of nesting colonies and the transport of young birds to market are probably the two single most important factors. Other important factors were excessive shooting, Newcastle disease, and towards the last of their years, the breakdown of social facilitation (Halliday 1980, Blockstein and Tordoff 1985, Bucher 1992).
7589	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Sorbeoconcha	Pleuroceridae	Elimia	clausa	Closed Elimia	3.1	2012		The major threat to this species was impoundment, which is thought to be the cause of extinction. The Coosa River was impounded several times, first in 1914 (Lay Lake) and most recently in 1967 (Lake Bouldin) (J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012).
7590	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Sorbeoconcha	Pleuroceridae	Elimia	fusiformis	Fusiform Elimia	3.1	2012	Elimia fusiformis is considered Extinct as it has been recorded that all of its habitat has been inundated by reservoirs. It was formerly endemic to the Coosa River from Shelby to Elmore Cos., Alabama, but following targeted surveys, it has not been reported since the river was impounded (Mirarchi 2004).	
7593	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Sorbeoconcha	Pleuroceridae	Elimia	jonesi	Hearty Elimia	3.1	2012		Impoundment was the main threat impacting this species and is thought to be responsible for the species' extinction. The Coosa River was impounded several times, first in 1914 (Lay Lake) and most recently in 1967 (Lake Bouldin) (J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012).
7595	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Sorbeoconcha	Pleuroceridae	Elimia	pilsbryi	Rough-lined Elimia	3.1	2012		The species is thought to be extinct because all of its former habitat is now impounded. A series of dams on the Coosa River raised the water level over the free-flowing shoals and covered them with silt (Neves et al. 1997).
7705	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Cyprinodontidae	Empetrichthys	merriami	Ash Meadows Poolfish, Ash Meadows Killifish	3.1	2013		This species went extinct in the late 1940s or early 1950s as a result of severe habitat alterations, possibly exacerbated by predation from exotic bullfrogs and crayfish (Miller et al. 1989).
7863	Mollusca	Bivalvia	Unionoida	Unionidae	Epioblasma	arcaeformis	Arc-form Pearly Mussel, Sugarspoon	2.3	2000	The habitat of this species has been severely modified or destroyed by damming. Annual surveys are conducted throughout the whole system and the species has not been collected for over 50 years. Damming along entire river systems has had an impact on this species which is now listed as Extinct.	Damming along entire river systems has had an impact on this species, which probably went Extinct in 1940.
7864	Mollusca	Bivalvia	Unionoida	Unionidae	Epioblasma	biemarginata	Angled Riffleshell	2.3	2000	The habitat of this species has been severely modified or destroyed by damming. A subpopulation sampled in 1967 was subsequently destroyed. Annual surveys are conducted throughout the whole system. Damming along entire river systems has had an impact on this species which is now listed as Extinct .	Damming along entire river systems has had an impact on this species, which probably went Extinct in 1940.
12081	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Dipsadidae	Erythrolamprus	perfuscus	Barbados Racer, Tan Ground Snake	3.1	2016		Mongoose were introduced to Barbados in the 1870s, and the species seems to have declined drastically from that period. The four specimens reported by Elmsley (1963) were from a locality identified as being in St. Joseph Parish on the border with St. John (Underwood et al. 1999). The species has never since been recorded. This record - from the most remote area of the island - is consistent with a remnant population close to extinction, and the lack of any subsequent records strongly suggests that it has now been lost. There are only around 20 ha of forest remaining on Barbados, a heavily-developed island.It is not known whether this species was able to survive in degraded habitats, although the last recorded specimens include records from the grounds of a school. Repeated targeted surveys aiming to rediscover this species have failed to record it, and it is presumed to be extinct.
22728889	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Erythromachus	leguati	Rodrigues Rail	3.1	2016		It was flightless and apparently excellent eating, and was therefore heavily hunted.
8128	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Perciformes	Percidae	Etheostoma	sellare	Maryland Darter	3.1	2013		The damming of the Susquehanna River reduced range. The last known occupied locality is in an area of degraded water quality impacted by agricultural runoff.
201472	Arthropoda	Diplopoda	Spirobolida	Pachybolidae	Eucarlia	alluaudi		3.1	2014		The species is now extinct but it was threatened by habitat deterioration due to the effects of invasive plant species, mainly as a result of abandonment of coconut plantations on Marianne island.
22731930	Chordata	Aves	Falconiformes	Falconidae	Falco	duboisi	Reunion Kestrel, Réunion Kestrel	3.1	2016		Reasons for its extinction are unknown, but persecution and the depredations of introduced human commensals are implicated.
103811601	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Ploceidae	Foudia	delloni	Reunion Fody	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of Rèunion (to France), where it was once described as abundant. It was last seen shortly after 1672 and was likely driven to extinction following the arrival of rats on the island. It is therefore classified as Extinct.	The species was likely driven to extinction following the arrival of rats on the island (Cheke and Hume 2008).
22710840	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Sturnidae	Fregilupus	varius	Reunion Starling, Réunion Starling	3.1	2016		Reasons for its extinction are unclear but may possibly be due to an introduced disease, combined with changing population pressure due to the emancipation of slaves in 1848, forest fires, drought and deforestation (Cheke 1987). It has been described as tame and easy to knock down with sticks, so hunting may have also played a part.
22728769	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Fulica	newtonii	Mascarene Coot	3.1	2016		"They were presumably hunted to extinction, despite the fact that they were ""not good to eat"" (Cheke 1987)."
8706	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Fundulidae	Fundulus	albolineatus	Whiteline Topminnow	3.1	2013		The only known occurrence locality has been pumped dry on several occasions, banks lined with cement, outflow impounded, and stocked with goldfish and carp.
22728763	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Gallinula	nesiotis	Tristan Moorhen, Tristan Gallinule	3.1	2016	This species is likely to have become Extinct in the late 19th century as a result of predation by rats, though this may have been in combination with feral cat and pig predation, habitat destruction and hunting by islanders.	It became extinct as a result of hunting, predation by introduced rats, cats and pigs, and habitat destruction by fire (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).
8888	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Poeciliidae	Gambusia	amistadensis	Amistad Gambusia	3.1	2013	This species is listed as Extinct because the only population was exterminated by a reservoir, and captive populations were genetically contaminated by western mosquitofish.	
8891	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Poeciliidae	Gambusia	georgei	San Marcos Gambusia	3.1	2013		Decline was due to reduced spring flows and pollution, including herbicide spraying along the river; introduced fishes; spread of an ornamental plant (Elephant Ears, Colocasia esculenta); and, as it became rare, hybridization with Gambusia affinis (Miller et al. 1989).
135637	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Gasterosteiformes	Gasterosteidae	Gasterosteus	crenobiontus		3.1	2008		Hybridisation with G. aculeatus which invaded its habitat when irrigation transformed the hypersaline lake which served as a natural barrier between the two species.
8987	Chordata	Mammalia	Cetartiodactyla	Bovidae	Gazella	bilkis	Queen of Sheba's Gazelle, Yemen Gazelle	3.1	2016		This species was hunted for food by army officers in 1951 (Sanborn and Hoogstraal 1953); there is no other information available.
8980	Chordata	Mammalia	Cetartiodactyla	Bovidae	Gazella	saudiya	Saudi Gazelle	3.1	2016	There have been no specimens collected or sightings of Gazella saudiya for several decades despite frequent surveys in areas of former habitat. Hammond et al. (2001) showed that three reported captive populations of G. saudiya represent different species or hybrids. Systematic investigations of privately owned populations throughout the Arabian Peninsula provided no evidence of surviving G. saudiya. Systematic investigations of captive collections throughout the Arabian Peninsula have failed to locate any captive individuals.	The main cause of its decline was over-hunting (Hammond et al. 2001).
9003	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Capromyidae	Geocapromys	thoracatus	Little Swan Island Hutia, Swan Island Hutia	3.1	2008		Driven to extinction through predation by introduced cats, which were released onto the islands prior to 1960. Local people report a very strong a hurricane in 1955 which may have added to the population decline.
9066	Nemertina	Enopla	Hoplonemertea	Prosorhochmidae	Geonemertes	rodericana		3.1	2014		The species was threatened in the 19th and 20th centuries by habitat destruction. This resulted in the complete loss of forest cover from the island and probably the extinction of this species.
22704724	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acanthizidae	Gerygone	insularis	Lord Howe Gerygone, Lord Howe Island Gerygone	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia, but was driven Extinct by the depredations of introduced rats. It was last recorded in 1928, with none found on a survey in 1936.	
9183	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Gila	crassicauda	Thicktail Chub	3.1	2013		Extinction probably resulted from change in habitat: removal of tule beds; drainage of large lakes; reduction in stream flows; alteration of stream channels; introduction of exotic species (Moyle 1976). Dam building, introduction of non-native competitors, interbreeding and hybridization, and water diversion for irrigation all contributed to extinction (Day 1981).
41027	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Graecoanatolica	macedonica		3.1	2011		The species is thought to have become extinct as a result of habitat loss through water abstraction (Ryan and Griffiths 2001). Lake levels declined from maximum water depth of 10.4 m in the 1930s to 5.6 m in 1995, and water abstraction is still ongoing in the area as the lake's feeder streams and underlying aquifer continue to be used for agricultural purposes (Ryan and Griffiths 2001). Recently, shells have been found at the lake, suggesting that it is possible that the species may survive in a small pocket, or has modified it's habitat.
22693621	Chordata	Aves	Charadriiformes	Haematopodidae	Haematopus	meadewaldoi	Canarian Oystercatcher, Canarian Black Oystercatcher	3.1	2016		Its decline was probably a result of overharvesting of intertidal invertebrates and disturbance by people (Hockey 1987), although predation by rats and cats has also been implicated (Collar and Stuart 1985).
156503	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Hygromiidae	Helicopsis	paulhessei		3.1	2011		The area is a place of excessive recreational influence now.
103823595	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Hemignathus	lucidus	Oahu Nukupuu	3.1	2016		This distinct species was originally collected in 1837 and went extinct sometime around the start of the 20th century. Deforestation had cleared much lowland habitat, but on other islands its sister species occurred to high elevations. Multiple invasive species were already established on Oahu in the 19th century, with the arrival of Rattus rattus shortly followed by Small Indian Mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus in an attempt at control possibly having the most significant effect on Oahu Nukupu'u. The arrival of avian pox and and avian malaria may have ensured extinction, either that or Hemignathus lucidus had checked out even before these additional disasters arrived on the shores of this 'paradise' island.
22708091	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Callaeidae	Heteralocha	acutirostris	Huia	3.1	2016	This species is known from New Zealand's North Island, but it was last recorded in 1907 and is now Extinct. Habitat loss, hunting and disease have all been implicated in its decline.	
103829706	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Himatione	fraithii	Laysan Honeycreeper	3.1	2016		The introduction of rabbits as a food supply for the guano miners that worked the Laysan Islands at the turn of the 20th Century was disastrous for the species. Virtually all vegetative cover on the island was eliminated, and the final three individuals were apparently killed in a vicious storm in 1923, with no shelter remaining on the island (Olson 1996, Fancy and Ralph 1997).
21460734	Arthropoda	Arachnida	Opiliones	Phalangodidae	Hirstienus	nanus		3.1	2014		The habitats that this species probably occurred in are deteriorating due to the effects of invasive plant species, especially Cinnamomum verum.
10303	Chordata	Mammalia	Sirenia	Dugongidae	Hydrodamalis	gigas	Steller's Sea Cow	3.1	2016		Hydrodamalis was slaughtered for its meat and leather. Anderson (1995) discussed the ecological interaction between sea cows, sea otters, Strongylocentrotus sea urchins, and kelp, and suggested that human predation on sea otters (resulting in a nearshore community dominated by sea urchins, which largely eliminate shallow-water kelps leading to their replacement by chemically defended deep-water species) was a major factor, along with hunting, in sea cow extinction. Turvey et al. (2006) assessed whether hunting alone would have been sufficient to wipe out the sea cow, and showed that the speed of sea cow disappearance on Bering Island indicates that hunting alone was more than sufficient to exterminate the species without having to invoke any additional ecological pressures. Conversely, Estes et al. (2015) argued that hunting of sea otters alone could account for the sea cowsâ extinction. Since both pressures actually occurred, there is no difficulty in understanding the rapid disappearance of Hydrodamalis from the Commander Islands.
10332	Arthropoda	Insecta	Trichoptera	Hydropsychidae	Hydropsyche	tobiasi	Tobias' Caddisfly	3.1	2014	This species occurred in an intensively studied part of the world and has not been recorded since 1938 despite searches for it in all recorded localities. Voucher specimens were only found in collections originating from the start of the 20th century and the last specimen was found on 4 August 1938. The Rhine and Main rivers were heavily polluted during the 20th century and almost all Trichoptera species became extinct there. Many caddis species have recovered since but Hydropsyche tobiasi was not found despite intensive searching in 1979 near Oppenheim, Wiesbaden-Schierstein, Ingelheim and in 2003-2004 near St. Goarshause und Kaub. The species was never found elsewhere and it was probably an endemic of the middle Rhine and Main rivers. It is therefore considered to be Extinct. The cause of extinction was probably the extensive river pollution in the Rhine and Main rivers in the early 20th century.	
22692455	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Hypotaenidia	dieffenbachii	Dieffenbach's Rail	3.1	2016	This species was found on the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, but was driven to extinction by the depredations of introduced species. The type material was collected in 1840, and it was Extinct by 1872.	
22692450	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Hypotaenidia	pacifica	Tahiti Rail	3.1	2016		It was flightless, and its extinction was presumably caused by introduced cats and rats (Bruner 1972).
22728740	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Hypotaenidia	poeciloptera	Bar-winged Rail	3.1	2016	This species was found in Fiji, but it has not been recorded since 1973 and is now Extinct. Predation by introduced cats and mongooses is thought to have been responsible for its decline.	Two other (non-endemic) rails have become extinct from the islands due to predation by introduced mongooses and cats, and so it seems very likely that this also caused the extinction of H. poeciloptera (Collar et al. 1994).
22692447	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Hypotaenidia	wakensis	Wake Rail	3.1	2016		It was presumably eaten to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison between 1942 and 1945 (Greenway 1967). Occasional inundations of the island during storms are also thought to have caused considerable mortality. The species is likely to have coexisted with rats since prehistoric times, and despite some suggestions it is not thought that rat predation was a factor in its extinction (Olson and Rauzon 2011).
59445	Chordata	Amphibia	Caudata	Salamandridae	Hypselotriton	wolterstorffi	Yunnan Lake Newt	3.1	2004		The extinction of this species was related to habitat destruction and degradation resulting from general pollution, land reclamation, domestic duck farming and the introduction of exotic fish and frog species.
3172	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Bufonidae	Incilius	periglenes	Golden Toad, Monte Verde Toad, Monte Verde Golden Toad, Alajuela Toad, Orange Toad	3.1	2008		Its restricted range, global warming, chytridiomycosis and airborne pollution probably contributed to this species' extinction.
155726	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Islamia	ateni		3.1	2011		This spa has been profoundly altered due to the construction of a road as well as future possible changes to the habitat through site management for tourism and water use.
10860	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Capromyidae	Isolobodon	portoricensis	Puerto Rican Hutia	3.1	2008		The main threat in the past which led to the decline of this population was probably predation by introduced mongooses and Rattus rattus. The species was historically hunted by Arawak Indians, however, this likely did not lead to the decline of the species as it went extinct following European settlement.
10946	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Juscelinomys	candango	Candango Mouse	3.1	2008	This species is listed as Extinct because it has not been recorded since 1960, and exhaustive surveys in suspected habitat throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. The entire region surrounding the type locality (now Brasila) has been converted from native habitats to an urban center with extensive ongoing suburban sprawl. The species likely went extinct shortly after being discovered.	
11073	Arthropoda	Insecta	Dermaptera	Labiduridae	Labidura	herculeana	St Helena Giant Earwig, St Helena Earwig, Saint Helena Earwig	3.1	2014	This is the world's largest known earwig, attaining a length of up to 80 mm. A total of 40 specimens were collected from the Horse Point area during the two Belgian expeditions from the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1965-6 and 1967 (Brindle 1970). Live specimens were not found at any other sites at this time although they reported fragments of dead individuals from the south and east flanks of Flagstaff. There are a couple of unconfirmed records that the species was present after this time and it was thought to be declining.   The habitat at Horse Point has been degraded as far as this species is concerned since the time of the Belgian expeditions by the removal of nearly all surface stones, under which specimens were then found, for construction purposes. There has also been potential increased predator pressure from mice and rats, and probably also from invasive non-native predatory invertebrates including spiders and the centipede Scolopendra morsitans Linnaeus, 1758. The only possible evidence that this species may have persisted beyond the time of the Belgian expeditions has been the discovery of fragments of dead individuals. A sub-fossil forcep and ninth abdominal tergite was found with bird bones in 1995 near Prosperous Bay. Two further ninth abdominal tergites have been recovered since. The first was found under a discarded piece of equipment in the centre of Horse Point Plain in 2013; the second in a small area at the Millennium Forest in 2014 where some remaining surface rock is present. However, this second fragment was found in a concentration of invertebrate remains in the lair of a predatory spider. As all of these remains are fragmentary and the insect itself relatively robust with remains persisting potentially for many decades it has to be assumed that these specimens had been dead for a considerable time. The species is large, charismatic and of iconic status on the island; while there is still a slim possibility that it may still persist in some remote location, the balance of evidence points towards the species being extinct. The last confirmed adult sighting was in May 1967.	There has been a general decline in habitat quality and an increase in the number of invasive non-native predators including rats, mice, spiders and the centipede Scolopendra morsitans Linnaeus, 1758. Habitat has also been altered in the past due to removal of surface stones for building.
11160	Chordata	Mammalia	Diprotodontia	Macropodidae	Lagorchestes	asomatus	Kuluwarri, Central Hare Wallaby, Central Hare-wallaby	3.1	2016		Major factors contributing to extinction are considered to be predation by introduced feral cats and red foxes, possibly exacerbated by changed fire regimes after Aboriginal people moved to settlements.
11163	Chordata	Mammalia	Diprotodontia	Macropodidae	Lagorchestes	leporides	Eastern Hare-wallaby, Eastern Hare Wallaby	3.1	2016		It has been suggested that an important factor in the decline of hare-wallabies has been the alteration of grassland habitat through trampling and grazing by sheep and cattle. The removal of aboriginal Australians from large areas by European settlers may also have contributed to loss of hare-wallabies by resulting in the removal of regular winter burning regimes and increasing the likelihood of devastating lightening-caused fires in summer months.
11388	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Tropiduridae	Leiocephalus	eremitus	Navassa Curlytail Lizard	3.1	2016		It is thought that predation by cats may have contributed to the extinction of this species (Medina et al. 2011), but while cats could certainly have wiped out this species the ultimate cause of its extinction is unknown (R. Powell pers. comm. 2015, 2016).
177653	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Leiorhagium	solemi		3.1	2011		Land clearance for human development and purpose-lit fires have increased in the area, and this has accelerated the drying out of nearby springs and seepages (P. Bouchet pers. comm. 2010). The reduction of native forest as Melaleuca (paper bark) has become the predominant species would also have negatively impacted this mollusc (P. Bouchet pers. comm. 2010). For the first half of the 20th century, it was recorded that the creeks had a higher volume of water flow than they do now, with many of the creeks currently only running seasonally (P. Bouchet pers. comm. 2010).
11459	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Lauriidae	Leiostyla	lamellosa	Madeiran Land Snail	3.1	2011	In the past this species has been listed as Extinct, as there have been no records since 1878. The only recent records (pre-1878) were in Ribeira de Sta Luzia above Funchal and the ravine of Vasco Gil on the main island of Madeira (Wollaston, 1878). Pilsbry (1922-26) gives the range as at intermediate elevations (ca 600â1,000 m) on the southern side of Madeira. This species has not been recorded living for 150 years. Surveys have been carried out in suitable habitats and at the last known localities between 1970s and 2000 but as yet no recent shells have been found. Some of the possible habitats have limited protection for the landscape (Riberio de Sta Luzia). Other potential habitats are within the National Park, where habitat disturbance is under control of the Regional Government. The region of Vasco Gil has largely been modified with conifer plantations and Eucalyptus forest replacing the native vegetation. Seddon (2008) suggested it could be listed as Critically Endangered, Possibly Extinct B1ab(iii), given the number of other species on Madeira that have been refound after over 60 years without records, however as it is already listed as Extinct, it is considered prudent to wait until it is refound.	Some of the habitats have been modified since it was last recorded in 1878.
11577	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Lepidomeda	altivelis	Pahranagat Spinedace	3.1	2013		Its extinction possibly was due to competition with or predation by introduced species (carp, mosquitofish, bullfrogs) (Miller et al. 1989).
11633	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Leporillus	apicalis	Lesser Stick-nest Rat, White-tipped Stick-nest Rat	3.1	2016		Predation by feral cats is considered the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonized the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes in range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.
19148	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Ranidae	Lithobates	fisheri	Las Vegas Leopard Frog	3.1	2004		It is extinct evidently due to habitat loss resulting from spring capture and ground water pumping by the growing city of Las Vegas (URS 1977), and exacerbated by the introduction of the Bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. Although some suitable habitat persists within or near the former range of this species, only R. catesbeiana can be found.
22728844	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Lophopsittacus	bensoni	Mauritius Grey Parrot	3.1	2016		It was widely eaten and is likely to have become extinct through overhunting.
22728847	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Lophopsittacus	mauritianus	Broad-billed Parrot, Mauritius Parrot	3.1	2016		Birds were large and were poor fliers, but not flightless (Holyoak 1971), and consequently heavily hunted (Cheke 1987) and this is likely to have caused its extinction.
103824105	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Loxops	wolstenholmei	Oahu Akepa	3.1	2016		The species is thought to have been driven to extinction by habitat destruction and disease.
197874	Arthropoda	Malacostraca	Decapoda	Palaemonidae	Macrobrachium	leptodactylus		3.1	2013		Since the species was collected 1888, the Bogor Regency has developed significantly (urban and agriculture). There are now 1,791 people per km2 according to 2010 official population census of the Bogor Regency.
12625	Chordata	Mammalia	Diprotodontia	Macropodidae	Macropus	greyi	Toolache Wallaby	3.1	2016		Habitat loss and fragmentation was catastrophic as the whole original range is now agricultural land. The introduced red fox and hunting contributed to the extinction.
12651	Chordata	Mammalia	Peramelemorphia	Thylacomyidae	Macrotis	leucura	Yallara, Lesser Bilby	3.1	2016		Predation from introduced feral cats and red foxes is considered to be the major cause of extinction, probably exacerbated by changes in fire regime.
199495	Arthropoda	Insecta	Blattodea	Blattellidae	Margatteoidea	amoena		3.1	2012		The entire range of the species is at sea level; any change will eliminate all habitat. It has not been recorded since 1905 and is probably extinct. A large fire in 2007 severely damaged remaining woodland areas.
18979	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Marstonia	olivacea	Olive Marstonia	3.1	2011		This species went extinct due to impoundment in the Tennessee Valley.
22728866	Chordata	Aves	Strigiformes	Strigidae	Mascarenotus	grucheti	Reunion Owl	3.1	2016		Hunting, deforestation and the depredations of introduced predators may all be implicated in its decline.
22728856	Chordata	Aves	Strigiformes	Strigidae	Mascarenotus	murivorus	Rodrigues Owl	3.1	2016		Hunting, deforestation and predation by human commensals are likely to have caused its extinction.
22728861	Chordata	Aves	Strigiformes	Strigidae	Mascarenotus	sauzieri	Mauritius Owl	3.1	2016		Deforestation, and perhaps also hunting as well as predation by introduced mammals caused its extinction.
22685258	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Mascarinus	mascarin	Mascarene Parrot	3.1	2016	This species was known from the island of Rèunion, but it has gone Extinct as a result of hunting pressure. The last record of wild birds dates from 1775, and none were observed on a visit in 1804.	It is likely to have been hunted to extinction.
12953	Arthropoda	Insecta	Odonata	Coenagrionidae	Megalagrion	jugorum	Maui Upland Damselfly	2.3	1996		Feral ungulates; ants.
12980	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Megalomys	desmarestii	Desmarest's Pilorie, Antillean Giant Rice Rat	3.1	2008		Most likely extinct due to the introduction of mongoose - although it has been suggested that the eruption of Mt. Pele in 1902 might have played a role in its final decline.
12981	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Megalomys	luciae	Santa Lucian Pilorie, Santa Lucia Giant Rice Rat	3.1	2008		Presumably went extinct due to mongoose introductions, as the last historical record slightly predates the introduction of the mongoose.
184749	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Mercuria	letourneuxiana		3.1	2010		This species is threatened by pollution of the thermal springs.
22680496	Chordata	Aves	Anseriformes	Anatidae	Mergus	australis	Auckland Merganser, Auckland Island Merganser	3.1	2016		Its decline was presumably caused by a combination of hunting and predation by introduced pigs, rats, cats and dogs(Kear and Scarlett 1970) - the species's incipient flightlessness made it especially vulnerable (Livezey 1989b).
21460777	Arthropoda	Arachnida	Opiliones	Zalmoxidae	Metazalmoxis	ferruginea		3.1	2014		This species was last recorded in 1892. Since this time habitat has deteriorated significantly due to the effects of invasive plant species and this was probably the main factor leading to its extinction.
22691086	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Microgoura	meeki	Choiseul Pigeon, Solomon Islands Crowned-pigeon, Kuvojo, Solomons Crested Pigeon	3.1	2016	This species is known from Choiseul, Solomon Islands, but it has not been recorded since 1904 and is now Extinct. It is likely to have been heavily predated by introduced dogs and cats.	Its extinction was presumably caused by predation by feral dogs and especially cats (Tennent 2009), as suitable habitat remains on the island (Collar et al. 1994).
73	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Mirogrex	hulensis	Hula Bream	3.1	2014		The Hula swamp was artificially drained by 1957 in order to obtain good agricultural land. Such agricultural development led to massive reduction in the number and size of aquatic ecosystems, due to the diversion and exploitation of their sources. Drainage of the lake resulted in the species being restricted to marsh and pond areas in Hula nature reserve. The reserve management switched from using spring water to fishpond water in the species' habitat, resulting in decline and the extinction of the fish within six years of doing so.
22704329	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Mohoidae	Moho	apicalis	Oahu Oo, O'ahu 'O'o	3.1	2016		Its extinction was presumably caused by a combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of disease-carrying mosquitoes (Pratt 1994).
22704335	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Mohoidae	Moho	bishopi	Bishop's Oo, Bishop's 'O'o, Molokai 'o'o	3.1	2016		Habitat destruction caused by conversion to agriculture and grazing by feral mammals inevitably initiated the species's decline, with introduced black rat Rattus rattus and the spread of disease carried by introduced mosquitoes blamed for the population crash early in the 20th century (Pratt 1994).
22704323	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Mohoidae	Moho	braccatus	Kauai Oo, Kaua'i 'O'o	3.1	2016		Habitat destruction and the introduction of black rat Rattus rattus, pigs and disease-carrying mosquitoes to the lowlands were the probable causes of this species's extinction (Collar et al. 1994).
22704342	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Mohoidae	Moho	nobilis	Hawaii Oo, Hawai'i 'O'o	3.1	2016		Its decline to extinction was presumably caused by both habitat destruction and disease. While it has been shown that the feathers of this species were used in early Hawaiian ornaments, it is thought that collection played only a minor role in its extinction relative to other factors (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).
39291	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Catostomidae	Moxostoma	lacerum	Harelip Sucker	3.1	2013		Formerly, the species was common but it is now extinct, probably due to increased turbidity and siltation of habitat resulting from agricultural practices (Miller et al. 1989).
22728746	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Mundia	elpenor	Ascension Crake, Ascension Flightless Crake	3.1	2016		Its extinction was probably caused by the introduction of rats and cats (Olson 1973).
22708559	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Turdidae	Myadestes	myadestinus	Kamao, Hawaiian Thrush, Kama'o	3.1	2016		Disease carried by introduced mosquitoes and the destruction and degradation of forests are likely to have been the chief causes of extinction (USFWS 1983). The advance of feral pigs into pristine upland forests degraded habitat and facilitated the spread of mosquitoes (Pratt 1994). Competition with introduced birds may have exacerbated the problems faced by this species (Wakelee and Fancy 1999), and introduced predators are likely to have also played a part (Woodworth et al. 2009). Deprived of lowland forest the species was also exposed to the effects of hurricane damage in upland forest, which severely disrupted portions of native forest and allowed the germination and expansion of noxious weeds (Pratt 1994, Conant et al. 1998). Also potentially detrimental to the remaining suitable habitat are introductions of new alien invertebrates, such as the two-spotted leafhopper (Sophonia rufofascia), which may threaten many food plants of M. myadestinus (USFWS 2003).
22708564	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Turdidae	Myadestes	woahensis	Amaui, 'Amaui	3.1	2016		The cause of the species's extinction is unknown (Greenway 1967), but habitat destruction and avian malaria are likely causal factors.
22707354	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Monarchidae	Myiagra	freycineti	Guam Flycatcher, Guam Broadbill	3.1	2016		Its rapid decline to extinction was due to the depredations of introduced brown tree snake Boiga irregularis (Savidge 1987).
22728841	Chordata	Aves	Cuculiformes	Cuculidae	Nannococcyx	psix	St Helena Cuckoo	3.1	2016	This species was formerly found on St Helena. It is now Extinct, presumably as a result of island deforestation in the 18th century.	Its extinction is likely to have occurred as a result of the deforestation of the island.
22710836	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Sturnidae	Necropsar	rodericanus	Rodrigues Starling, Rodriguez Starling	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, Mauritius, but is now Extinct, probably due to a combination of hunting, habitat loss and the action of invasive species. The last records date from 1726, and the species was not found on a visit in 1761.	The reason for this species's extinction is unknown (Cheke 1987), but hunting, habitat destruction and the depredations of introduced mammals must surely all have contributed.
22728851	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Necropsittacus	rodricanus	Rodrigues Parrot	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, Mauritius, but is now Extinct. It was last reported in 1761 and presumably hunted to extinction soon after.	Hunting is likely to have caused its extinction.
13655	Chordata	Mammalia	Carnivora	Phocidae	Neomonachus	tropicalis	Caribbean Monk Seal, West Indian Seal, West Indian Monk Seal	3.1	2015		The only known predators of Caribbean Monk Seals were sharks and humans. Intensive exploitation began with the voyages of Columbus, and continued for centuries afterwards, as the seals were killed for their skins and oil. In more recent years, the seal was also subject to persecution from the fishing industry. This human pressure brought the population to very low numbers, ultimately resulting in extinction of the species (Allen 2004, Hairr 2011).
14556	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Hygrophila	Planorbidae	Neoplanorbis	tantillus	Little Flat-top Snail	3.1	2012		Past impoundment of its habitat was the main threat to this species and has ultimately led to its extinction. The Coosa River was impounded several times, first in 1914 (Lay Lake) and most recently in 1967 (Lake Bouldin) (J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012).
14576	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Neotoma	anthonyi	Anthony's Woodrat	3.1	2008		Predation by feral cats has been cited as the primary reason for extirpation of this species (Cortes-Calva et al. 2001).
14577	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Neotoma	bunkeri	Bunker's Woodrat, Coronados Island Woodrat	3.1	2008		Depletion of food resources and predation by feral cats has been cited as likely causes of the extirpation of this species (Smith et al. 1993).
14580	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Neotoma	martinensis	San Martin Island Woodrat	3.1	2008		Predation by feral cats has been cited as a primary threat to the extirpation of this species (Cortes-Calva et al. 2001).
40784	Chordata	Mammalia	Carnivora	Mustelidae	Neovison	macrodon	Sea Mink	3.1	2016	Sea Mink is Extinct. It was thought to have survived until about 1894 in New Brunswick (Campbell 1988, Nowak 1999), but it is uncertain whether these animals belonged to this species or to Neovison vison. Mead et al. (2000) substantiated the validity of Sea Mink as a species and estimated the extinction date as about 1860. This species was hunted to extinction (apparently for the fur trade).	
22714587	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acrocephalidae	Nesillas	aldabrana	Aldabra Brush-warbler	3.1	2016		There is little suitable habitat on Aldabra, which is likely to have played a part in its extinction. It is likely that rat and cat predation was more important though, as well as degradation of its habitat by tortoises and goats (Hambler et al. 1985, Skerrett and Disley 2011).
62257034	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Nesoenas	cicur	Mauritius Turtle-dove	3.1	2016		This species probably became extinct as a result of overhunting, predation by invasive mammals such as Black Rats, and deforestation (Hume and Walters 2012).
22728712	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Nesoenas	duboisi	Reunion Pigeon	3.1	2016		Hunting, and perhaps also introduced predators, are likely to have caused its rapid demise.
22728722	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Nesoenas	rodericanus	Rodrigues Turtle-dove	3.1	2016		The species was described as being tame and easily hunted, but the presence of Black Rats Rattus rattus was likely the main driver of extinction (Hume and Walters 2012).
41313	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Nesophontidae	Nesophontes	edithae	Edith's Island-shrew, Edith's Nesophont, Puerto Rican Nesophontes	3.1	2008	Listed as Extinct, because this species is known to have survived across its range (based on radiocarbon dating) only until the time of European arrival (post 1500), but has not been recorded since.	Introduced rats are the most likely reason for the species' extinction.
14672	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Nesophontidae	Nesophontes	hypomicrus	Atalaye Nesophontes	3.1	2008		Introduced rats are the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. Remains of this species have been found together with those of Rattus spp. and Mus spp. which were introduced to the island by European ships. The burning of forests for cultivation purposes is also considered to have pushed these species to extinction.
136381	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Nesophontidae	Nesophontes	major		3.1	2008		Introduced rats are the most probable reason for the extinction of this species. Fossil deposits of this species have been found with rat fossils.
14673	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Nesophontidae	Nesophontes	micrus	Western Cuban Nesophontes	3.1	2008		Introduced rats are the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. Remains of this species have been found together with those of Rattus spp. and Mus spp. which were introduced to the island by European ships. The burning of forests for cultivation purposes is also considered to have pushed these species to extinction.
14674	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Nesophontidae	Nesophontes	paramicrus	St. Michel Nesophontes	3.1	2008		Introduced rats are the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. Remains of this species have been found together with those of Rattus spp. and Mus spp. which were introduced to the island by European ships. The burning of forests for cultivation purposes is also considered to have pushed these species to extinction.
14676	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Nesophontidae	Nesophontes	zamicrus	Haitian Nesophontes	3.1	2008		Introduced rats are the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. Remains of this species have been found together with those of Rattus spp. and Mus spp. which were introduced to the island by European ships. The burning of forests for cultivation purposes is also considered to have pushed these species to extinction.
14706	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Nesoryzomys	darwini	Darwin's Galapagos Mouse	3.1	2008	Nesoryzomys darwini was apparently restricted to the island of Santa Cruz where it was first collected in 1906 and last seen in 1930. The extinction of this species is attributed to the introduction of the Black Rat Rattus rattus to the island in the late 1930s and due to pathogens to which the native species were susceptible or through direct competition with the introduced species. Other species introduced include House Mouse Mus musculus, the Norway Rat R. norvegicus and feral cats, all of which would also have had an impact on rodent decline and extinction. Recent repeated surveys have failed to locate any individuals of this species.	The introduction of the black rat (Rattus rattus) is the main cause of the extinction of this species.
14708	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Nesoryzomys	indefessus	Indefatigable Galapagos Mouse	3.1	2008	This species is listed as Extinct as specimens were last collected in 1934 and repeated surveys at several places on the island have failed to locate any individuals. The extinction is probably due to the introduction of the Black Rat Rattus rattus to the island in the late 1930s and was either the result of the introduction of pathogens to which the native species was susceptible or through direct competition with the introduced species. Other species introduced include House Mouse Mus musculus, the Norway Rat R. norvegicus and feral cats, all of which would also have had an impact on rodent decline and extinction.	The introduction of the black rat (Rattus rattus) is the cause of the probable extinction of this species.
22684834	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Strigopidae	Nestor	productus	Norfolk Kaka	3.1	2016		It was reportedly tame, and hence heavily hunted for food by convicts and early settlers and easily trapped as a pet.
14861	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Notomys	amplus	Short-tailed Hopping-mouse	3.1	2016		The reasons for the loss of this species are unknown, but may be related to predation by introduced species such as foxes and feral cats.
14864	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Notomys	longicaudatus	Long-tailed Hopping-mouse	3.1	2016		Extinction is attributed to predation by feral cats. Extinction occurred prior to the arrival of the Red Fox in WA and parts of central Australia; feral Cats had colonised all of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008) and have been implicated in the extinction of a range of larger rodents and other medium-sized mammals.
14865	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Notomys	macrotis	Big-eared Hopping-mouse	3.1	2016		Extinction is considered to be primarily caused by predation by feral cats. The Large-eared Hopping-mouse's habitat, loamy valley soils with grass, was used for sheep herding at the time of extinction; this would have degraded its habitat and collapsed its burrows. Evidence for epizootic disease as the primary factor, but probably interacting with drought and predation by feral cats as secondary factors, in decline and extinction of many mammal species in Western Australia; many of these declined before the arrival of foxes (Abbott 2006).
14866	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Notomys	mordax	Darling Downs Hopping-mouse	3.1	2016		Extinction is considered to be due primarily to predation by feral cats. Habitat destruction for agriculture and habitat degradation due to livestock may have contributed.
14891	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Notropis	orca	Phantom Shiner	3.1	2013		The decline of this species probably was due to water diversion, dams and their impoundments (and loss of unstable flood-drought regime formerly characteristic of the Rio Grande), chemical pollution, salinity increase correlated with irrigation projects, and introduced fishes (Miller et al. 1989).
62286255	Chordata	Aves	Pelecaniformes	Ardeidae	Nyctanassa	carcinocatactes	Bermuda Night-heron	3.1	2016	This species is known only from subfossil remains. It likely became Extinct during the early 17th century as a result of invasive predators and hunting for food by human settlers.	It was probably driven to extinction by invasive predators such as feral cats, hunting, and perhaps a shortage of prey (Hume and Walters 2012).
22728781	Chordata	Aves	Pelecaniformes	Ardeidae	Nycticorax	duboisi	Reunion Night-heron	3.1	2016		"It was said to be ""good and fat"", hunting is therefore likely to have caused its extinction."
22728777	Chordata	Aves	Pelecaniformes	Ardeidae	Nycticorax	mauritianus	Mauritius Night-heron, Mauritius Night-Heron	3.1	2016	This species is known from the mainland of Mauritius. It was last recorded in 1693, and was probably driven Extinct by hunters before 1700.	Hunting is likely to have led to its extinction.
22728787	Chordata	Aves	Pelecaniformes	Ardeidae	Nycticorax	megacephalus	Rodrigues Night-heron, Rodrigues Night-Heron	3.1	2016		Leguat mentioned that they were easily caught (Hachisuka 1953), although they were not quite flightless (Cheke 1987). This hunting presumably caused their extinction.
15187	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Littorinimorpha	Hydrobiidae	Ohridohauffenia	drimica		3.1	2010		After a great drainage of the Drim River, surveys could not find this species anymore (Radoman 1985).
15255	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Oligoryzomys	victus	St Vincent Pygmy Rice Rat, St. Vincent Pygmy Rice Rat	3.1	2008	Extrapolating from the fact that every other rice rat species has been extirpated from the Lesser Antillean region due to introduced species, it is inferred that this species has become extinct for the same reason.	Black rats, brown rats, and mongoose are present on the island and likely resulted in the extinction of the species.
15331	Chordata	Mammalia	Diprotodontia	Macropodidae	Onychogalea	lunata	Crescent Nailtail Wallaby	3.1	2016		This species was probably extirpated by predation from introduced foxes and cats. Habitat degradation, including changing fire regimes and the impact of rabbits and introduced stock, may have had an impact. In part of their range (south-western Western Australia and parts of New South Wales), pastoral expansion leading to habitat degradation, mainly by sheep, was likely to have been detrimental to the species. There is evidence for epizootic disease as the primary factor, but probably interacting with drought and predation by feral cats as secondary factors, in decline and extinction of many mammal species in WA; many of these declined before the arrival of foxes; however, this epizootic did not greatly affect arid zone mammals (Abbott 2006)
15144	Arthropoda	Insecta	Coleoptera	Curculionidae	Oodemas	laysanensis	Laysan Weevil	3.1	2014	This weevil was restricted to Laysan island. It was last recorded in 1964 and is thought to be extinct. Extinction was probably due to extensive habitat degradation.	The species is extinct, probably as a result of decades of habitat degradation caused by introduced rabbits and plants.
201484	Arthropoda	Diplopoda	Polydesmida	Paradoxosomatidae	Orthomorpha	crinita		3.1	2014		It is likely that this species was threatened by habitat deterioration due to the effects of invasive plants, especially Cinnamomum verum, and climate change causing drying of higher, cloud associated habitats.
136540	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Oryzomys	antillarum	Jamaican Rice Rat	3.1	2008		Likely went extinct following the introduction of mongoose. The species was last recorded five years after the introduction of mongoose to Jamaica.
15583	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Cricetidae	Oryzomys	nelsoni	Nelson's Rice Rat, Tres Marias Island Rice Rat	3.1	2008		The extinction of the species may have been caused by Rattus rattus (Wilson 1991 in Alvarez-CastaÃ±eda and Mendez 2003).
168116	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Cerastidae	Pachnodus	curiosus		3.1	2009		Extinction was probably caused by extensive fires in the early 1800s, which destroyed all forest habitat on the island.
168112	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Cerastidae	Pachnodus	ladiguensis		3.1	2009		The cause of extinction is believed to be habitat destruction, as natural woodlands were replaced with large-scale wood plantations in the 1800s.
40091	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Cerastidae	Pachnodus	velutinus		3.1	2009		Being vulnerable to dessication, this species was historically threatened by habitat degradation and climatic changes. Hybridization with Pachnodus niger led to the extinction of this species in 1994.
15867	Arthropoda	Malacostraca	Decapoda	Astacidae	Pacifastacus	nigrescens	Sooty Crayfish	3.1	2010		Pacifastacus nigrescens is restricted to the San Francisco Bay region of northern California, but has disappeared as a result of urbanization and interactions with introduced crayfish species such as the Signal Crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and Procambarus clarkii (NatureServe 2009).
15949	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cyprinodontiformes	Poeciliidae	Pantanodon	madagascariensis		3.1	2016		A very restricted range, deforestation and resulting habitat destruction, coupled with the introduction of exotic species, primarily Gambusia species, are thought to have contributed to the decline of this taxon.
22720823	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Paroreomyza	flammea	Kakawahie, Molokai Creeper	3.1	2016		Its extinction was presumably due to habitat destruction and disease (Collar et al. 1994). It is not thought to have been collected for ornament (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).
16284	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Partulidae	Partula	arguta	Polynesian Tree Snail	3.1	2009	The carnivorous snail Euglandina rosea was introduced onto the island in the early 1990s and extinctions of endemic partulid species began immediately. Individuals of Partula arguta were collected for the ex-situ breeding programme during subsequent surveys but the last individual died in 1994. No live individuals were found during surveys in 2000.

By 1992 there were few left and no live individuals were found during surveys in 1994 and 2000 or during subsequent scientific expeditions to high altitudes.	The extinction of this species is attributed to the carnivorous snail Euglandina rosea which was introduced in the late 1980s.
16272	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Partulidae	Partula	aurantia	Moorean Viviparous Tree Snail, Polynesian Tree Snail	3.1	2009	The carnivorous snail Euglandina rosea was introduced onto the island in 1977 and there was immediate disastrous impact with this species being the first to go extinct as a result of predation. No live individuals of Partula aurantia were found during the intensive surveys of the 1980s or in 2005.	The extinction of this species is attributed to the carnivorous snail Euglandina rosea which was introduced onto the island in 1977.

16527	Chordata	Reptilia	Testudines	Pelomedusidae	Pelusios	seychellensis	Seychelles Mud Turtle, Seychelles Black Terrapin, Seychelles Terrapin	3.1	2003	Only three specimens are known, collected in 1895. One individual collected in 1994 was suggested to belong to this species, but this identification is ambiguous. It is possible that hybridization with P. castanoides intergularis may have occurred. The genetic relationships between the type specimens and living P. castanoides intergularis are currently under investigation. Intensive searches for P. seychellensis since 1996 have failed to locate any individuals.	
16570	Chordata	Mammalia	Peramelemorphia	Peramelidae	Perameles	eremiana	Desert Bandicoot	3.1	2016	The Desert Bandicoot is listed as Extinct because the most recent specimen, from Well 33 on the Canning Stock Route, was collected in 1943 (Gordon 2008). Western desert Aboriginal people recalled that it disappeared between 1940 and 1960, with some people reporting that they had eaten it near Lake Mackay as recently as the late 1960s (Burbidge et al. 1988).	"Its population decline was probably due to introduced predators: cats and foxes. Changes to the fire regime have also been blamed for species losses in inland arid areas of Australia â the gradual patchwork burning by aboriginal people was replaced by intensive ""lightening-caused"" wildfires which destroyed habitat diversity. Rabbits also likely had a major impact on its habitat."

22694856	Chordata	Aves	Charadriiformes	Alcidae	Pinguinus	impennis	Great Auk	3.1	2016		Details of how it was driven to extinction by hunting for its feathers, meat, fat and oil are well known (Grieve 1885). As birds became more scarce, specimen collecting became the proximate cause of their extinction (Birkhead 1994).
103772527	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Passerellidae	Pipilo	naufragus	Bermuda Towhee	3.1	2016	This newly-described species was endemic to Bermuda, but was likely driven Extinct by invasive predators following human settlement of the island in 1612.

22696615	Chordata	Aves	Podicipediformes	Podicipedidae	Podiceps	andinus	Colombian Grebe	3.1	2016		It declined as a combined result of wetland drainage, siltation, pesticide pollution, disruption by reed harvesting, hunting and predation by introduced rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Fjelds 1993).
22696577	Chordata	Aves	Podicipediformes	Podicipedidae	Podilymbus	gigas	Atitlan Grebe, Giant Grebe, Giant Pied-billed Grebe, Atitlán Grebe	3.1	2016		Initial population declines were a result of competition and predation by large-mouth bass Micropterus salmoides, introduced into the lake in 1960 (LaBastille 1984). However, increasing pressure on breeding sites from local reed-cutting and from tourism development, along with the murder of the government game warden for the national park during the political unrest of 1982 and falling lake levels following the earthquake of 1976, are likely to be the factors which drove the population to extinction (LaBastille 1990). Drowning in gill nets and disturbance by increasing boat traffic have also been suggested as contributory factors (Collar et al. 1994).
17874	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Pogonichthys	ciscoides	Clear Lake Splittail	3.1	2013		This species' population declined precipitously in the 1940s, probably due to reduced water flow caused by irrigation methods, and increase in bluegill population (Moyle 1976); and possibly also due to applications of pesticides (Miller et al. 1989).
22732926	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Monarchidae	Pomarea	fluxa	Eiao Monarch	3.1	2016		Introduced predators including feral cats, Polynesian rat Rattus exulans and possibly black rat R. rattus were present on the island at the time of the species's demise, and may have contributed to declines. The introduction of Chestnut-breasted Munia Lonchura castaneothorax coincided with its extinction on the island, implying that an avian disease may have been transmitted to this population (Thibault 1989). Native low-elevation dry forest has drastically decreased due to intense grazing by sheep introduced c.1880 (Holyoak and Thibault 1984, Thibault and Meyer 2001), and this may have been an additional factor.
22732936	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Monarchidae	Pomarea	nukuhivae	Nuku Hiva Monarch	3.1	2016		All the Marquesas Islands have been devastated by intense grazing and fire, and much of the original dry forest has been reduced to grassland, and upland forest to relict forest patches. Introduced species are also likely to have played a role in the species's demise, especially black rat Rattus rattus.
22724444	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Monarchidae	Pomarea	pomarea	Maupiti Monarch	3.1	2016		The Society Islands have lost most of their original vegetation and their avifauna has suffered greatly through competition and predation from introduced species (Todd 1984); these factors are likely to have caused its extinction.
22728902	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Locustellidae	Poodytes	rufescens	Chatham Fernbird, Chatham Island Fernbird, Chatham Islands Fernbird	3.1	2016		It presumably declined to extinction due to habitat loss caused by burning and overgrazing by introduced goats and rabbits, and to predation by cats (Fleming 1939).

Hunting and invasive species were the principal drivers of its decline.	Hunting and the depredations of introduced predators are likely to have driven it to extinction.
22728833	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Porphyrio	mantelli	North Island Takahe	3.1	2016		The decline of the species has generally been attributed to the increasing incursion of forest into the alpine grasslands through the Holocene (Mills et al. 1984), although hunting by the Maori probably also played a significant role (Beauchamp and Worthy 1988).
62263064	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Porphyrio	paepae	Marquesan Swamphen	3.1	2016	This newly-recognised gallinule may have survived until as late as 1937, but undoubtedly became Extinct soon after. It likely disappeared as a result of over-hunting and predation by invasive rats and cats.	Little is known, but it was presumably driven to extinction by hunting pressure and predation by invasive species.
62289108	Chordata	Aves	Charadriiformes	Scolopacidae	Prosobonia	cancellata	Christmas Sandpiper	3.1	2016	This newly-recognised Pacific sandpiper became Extinct around the 1850s as a result of predation by invasive mammals.	This species was presumably driven to extinction by introduced predatory mammals, especially cats and rats.
22728772	Chordata	Aves	Charadriiformes	Scolopacidae	Prosobonia	ellisi	Moorea Sandpiper	3.1	2016		It was presumably driven to extinction by introduced rats in the late 18th century (Walters 1994).

18384	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Osmeriformes	Retropinnidae	Prototroctes	oxyrhynchus	New Zealand Grayling	3.1	2014	The New Zealand Grayling (Prototroctes oxyrhynchus) is assessed as Extinct. It was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.	The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).
22685156	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Psephotellus	pulcherrimus	Paradise Parrot, Beautiful Parakeet	3.1	2016		Its extinction was probably sealed by a reduction of its food supply due to drought and overgrazing (Olsen 2007). Altered fire frequencies and the spread of prickly pears (Joseph 1988), disease, trapping and egg-collecting (Garnett 1992), predation of nests by introduced and native species (Chisholm 1922) and clearance of eucalypts by ringbarking (Kiernan 1993) also contributed. Following major reduction in the species's population size, it appears that inbreeding inhibited the birds' fertility (Jerrard 2008).

75927882	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Pseudomys	auritus	Long-eared Mouse	3.1	2016		Extinction likely due to a combination of predation by feral cats, land clearance and overgrazing by livestock.
18564	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Pseudomys	glaucus	Blue-grey Mouse, Blue-gray Mouse	3.1	2016		Extinction is considered to have been due to habitat clearance and predation by feral cats. Predation by red foxes may have contributed.
136000	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Rhacophoridae	Pseudophilautus	maia		3.1	2008		Clearance of the cloud forest adjacent to Frotoft Estate in 1978 might have lead to the extinction of this species (Meegaskumbura et al., 2007). The clearance of this forest resulted in the extinction of Albizia lankaensis (Mimosaceae), a tree species formerly endemic to this site (Kostermans 1980).
40747	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Pseudophoxinus	handlirschi	Egirdir Minnow	3.1	2014		The introduction of Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is believed to be the reason for the extirpation of the species.
22728696	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Psittacara	labati	Guadeloupe Parakeet	3.1	2016		Hunting is likely to have led to its extinction.
22685465	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Psittacula	exsul	Rodrigues Parakeet	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, Mauritius, but it has not been recorded since 1875 and is now Extinct. It is thought that hunting and habitat loss were major contributors to its decline, and that the final blow may have been dealt by vicious storms in 1876.	The species's extinction was presumably caused by a combination of habitat loss and hunting (Cheke 1987).
22685437	Chordata	Aves	Psittaciformes	Psittacidae	Psittacula	wardi	Seychelles Parakeet, Seychelles Parrot	3.1	2016		Clearance of forest for coconut plantations and shooting and trapping (in particular, to protect maize crops) were the main causes of the species's demise (Forshaw and Cooper 1989).
22728800	Chordata	Aves	Procellariiformes	Procellariidae	Pterodroma	rupinarum	Large St Helena Petrel, St Helena Gadfly Petrel	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to the island of St Helena, but is thought to have been hunted to extinction shortly after the island's discovery in 1502.	It presumably became extinct due to predation by people and introduced comensal species.
18761	Chordata	Mammalia	Chiroptera	Pteropodidae	Pteropus	subniger	Lesser Mascarene Flying-fox, Dark Flying Fox	3.1	2008		Both deforestation and local hunting are thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species. It was thought to have lived in hollow trees.
18763	Chordata	Mammalia	Chiroptera	Pteropodidae	Pteropus	tokudae	Guam Flying Fox, Guam Fruit Bat	3.1	2008		It was hunted locally as a food source, and this is thought to have been the main factor leading to the demise of the species. The introduction of the predatory Brown Tree Snake (Boiga irregularis) to Guam possibly contributed to the extinction of this species.
22691495	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Ptilinopus	mercierii	Red-moustached Fruit-dove, Moustached Fruit Dove, Red-moustached Fruit-Dove	3.1	2016	This species was found in the Marquesas, French Polynesia, but it is now Extinct due to the action of introduced predators. The last record was of the subspecies tristrami on Hiva Oa, in 1922.	Its extinction has been attributed to predation by the introduced Great Horned Owl Bubo virginianus (Holyoak and Thibault 1984), as well as by introduced rats and cats (Collar et al. 1994).
44504	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Perciformes	Cichlidae	Ptychochromis	onilahy		3.1	2016		The main impacts thought to have caused the decline of this species are deforestation leading to loss of habitat through increased sedimentation, competition from introduced tilapias and overfishing.
103682916	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Tyrannidae	Pyrocephalus	dubius	Least Vermilion Flycatcher	3.1	2016		It seems likely that either the introduction of rats, the arrival of avian pox or potentially the bot fly Philornis downsi, or some combination of all of these and potentially additional introductions caused the decline and extinction of the species.
22724314	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Icteridae	Quiscalus	palustris	Slender-billed Grackle	3.1	2016	This species was known from the Rio Lerma area, Mexico, but it has not been recorded since 1910 and is now Extinct. The draining of its wetland habitat is likely to have been the cause.	Its extinction was due to the draining of its habitat.
22690059	Chordata	Aves	Columbiformes	Columbidae	Raphus	cucullatus	Dodo	3.1	2016	This species was found in Mauritius, but is now Extinct as a result of hunting by settlers and nest predation by introduced pigs. Birds thought to represent the last individuals were killed on the offshore islet Ile d'Ambre in 1662. Due to its tameness and large size it was very heavily hunted for food by sailors (Hachisuka 1953).	
19344	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Rattus	macleari	Maclear's Rat	3.1	2016		"This species was still abundant in 1897-1898 while Andrews was on Christmas Island (Andrews 1900). By the time he returned to the island in 1908, he was confident that it and the other native rat species, Rattus nativitatis, were extinct (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) speculated that introduced Black Rats Rattus rattus had brought an epidemic disease to the island that wiped out both native rats. Nearly 100 years later, the mystery was finally solved by Wyatt et al. (2008), who used ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888â1908), and showed that endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of Black Rats were devoid of evidence of a pathogenic trypanosome (carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced Black Rats). To Andrews, the disappearance of such an abundant animal in such a short time had to be due to disease because R. rattus was not present over the entire island. It was unreasonable therefore to assume that the native species had been out-competed by R. rattus all over the island (Andrews 1909). Two predators had been introduced to the island by 1908, cat and dog, but these were far too few to rid the island of the rats (Andrews 1900, 1909). Although Christmas Island had an increasing human settlement at Flying Fish Cove, roads now crossed the island, and there was active phosphate mining, there was still a lot of native forest and even collectively these human disturbances were unlikely to have caused significant declines in the populations of Maclear's Rat (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) also relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904. Pickering and Norris (1996) report on documents concerning Maclear's Rat that were uncovered at Oxford University, and specimens from the Zoological Collections, University Museum, Oxford University and the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge. The documents include notes for a lecture by K. R. Hanitsch who visited Christmas Island for five weeks in 1904 and was unable to locate either species of native rat. Dr. Durham, a pathologist, visited the island from November 1901 to March 1902 and reported in expedition reports that he was told that R. rattus had been introduced to the island in 1899 by the S.S. Hindustan. Durham also collected 19 rat specimens. Pickering and Norris (1996) note that some of these specimens were of R. macleari, R. rattus, and some of varying degrees of hybrid between R. macleari and R. rattus. Hybridisation between the two species, with the implication that R. macleari was genetically swamped by R. rattus, was put forward as a contributing factor in the demise of R. macleari (Pickering and Norris 1996). However, hybridisation between the two species is unlikely given the phylogenetic distance between them, and apparently re-examination of specimens confirms that each belongs to one or the other species (Musser and Carleton 2005; Aplin 2008). This is further supported by the molecular studies of Wyatt et al. (2008).Because Durham collected specimens, some of which were R. macleari, in late 1901 and 1902, R. macleari must have become extinct after 1901. McDougal was the last person to recall seeing native rats alive, albeit in the act of dying (Andrews 1909). These rats were probably R. macleari because R. nativitatis was the rarer of the two, as evidenced by the fact that Durham was unable to collect any specimens of R. nativitatis in 1901-1902. Andrews (1909) writes that McDougal's recollections are from 5-6 years before, but it is unclear whether he meant 5-6 years prior to his 1909 publication (putting the date at 1903-1904), or if it was 5-6 years prior to 1908 when Andrews was on Christmas Island (putting the date as 1902-1903 as Pickering and Norris (1996) interpret the anecdote). Because Hanitsch was unable to locate the species in 1904, it is likely that the species already had become extinct.Green (2014) further defined the date of introduction of black rats (and hence trypanosomes) (September 1900) and the extinction of R. macleari (between April 1904 and October 1904)."
19351	Chordata	Mammalia	Rodentia	Muridae	Rattus	nativitatis	Bulldog Rat, Christmas Island Burrowing Rat	3.1	2016		"This species was last recorded by Andrews from his 10 month stay on Christmas Island 1897-1898 (Andrews 1900). At that time, it already appeared to be in decline. Although the species was known from the settlement at Flying Fish Cove, Andrews never encountered them there and believed they were mainly confined to higher ground (Andrews 1900, 1909). In the hills, he described them as ""very numerous in places"", but less common than R. macleari (Andrews 1900). Andrews (1900) states that ""it is difficult to avoid the belief that the former species [R. nativitatis] is being supplanted by the latter [R. macleari] in spite of the abundance of food.""By the time Andrews revisited the island in 1908, he was confident in pronouncing the species to be extinct (Andrews 1909). In 1904, Hanitsch visited the island hoping to collect specimens of the native rats, but was unable to locate either species (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for R. macleari for further details). Durham visited the island in November of 1901 to March 1902 and collected R. macleari and R. rattus, but was unable to obtain R. nativitatis, despite offering a reward to the local inhabitants (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for R. macleari for further details). Pickering and Norris (1996) note that Durham did not go far from Flying Fish Cove during his stay, thus he could well have missed R. nativitatis. However, Hanitsch's failure to obtain R. nativitatis in 1904 likely means that the species was extinct by this time. Andrews (1909) relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904, and these may have included R. nativitatis, but were likely to be R. macleari (see account for R. macleari for further details). The demise of the Bulldog Rat was certainly rapid, going from locally common to extinct in less than eight years. It is thought to have been the result of an epidemic disease brought to the island by introduced Black Rats R. rattus (Andrews 1909; Aplin 2008). Black Rats are thought to have been introduced to the island by the S.S. Hindustan in 1899 (Pickering and Norris 1996) - subsequently determined to be September 1900 by Green (2014). This hypothesis is supported by the study of Wyatt et al. (2008), who used ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888â1908), and showed that endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of Black Rats were devoid of evidence of a pathogenic trypanosome (carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced Black Rats)."
168122	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Stylommatophora	Cerastidae	Rhachistia	aldabrae	Aldabra Banded Snail	3.1	2009	This snail was locally abundant in the 1970s and, a rapid decline and difficulty finding individuals starting in the 1980s notwithstanding, was still represented by shells in 2000. However, despite extensive and repeated searches in all previously recorded and potentially inhabitable areas, no evidence of its continued survival has been found since then. The last live individual was seen in 1997. Rangers have been looking out for the species since 2006. It has been concluded that this species is extinct as a result of climate change (Gerlach 2007). Increasing frequency of dry years is believed to have led to neonatal mortality and complete recruitment failure, causing population senescence and extinction shortly after 1997.	This species was restricted to Aldabra atoll (area of occupancy estimated to be 150 km2), all of which is less than 8 m above sea level and mostly 1-2 m above sea level. Sea level rise was therefore a major threat throughout its range. A small number of rat-eaten shells have been found, indicating that low levels of rat predation were a minor threat. In the 1970s, the species was common and widespread, but declined rapidly thereafter. Only isolated individuals were found in the 1980s and the last one in 1997. An increase in the frequency of relatively dry years has been linked to this species' decline: it is thought that prolonged dry conditions led to mortality of juveniles and recruitment failure, ultimately causing population senescence and extinction.
19475	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Myobatrachidae	Rheobatrachus	silus	Southern Gastric Brooding Frog, Southern Platypus Frog	3.1	2004		The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially mistflower Ageratina riparia), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.
19476	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Myobatrachidae	Rheobatrachus	vitellinus	Eungella Gastric-brooding Frog, Northern Gastric Brooding Frog	3.1	2004		The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984-1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990). However, despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded within Eungella National Park or any other locations since March 1985 (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993; Hero et al. 1998, 2002; McDonald and Alford 1999). Eungella National Park is subject to weed invasion on the edges of the reserve (Winter and McDonald 1986). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, chytridiomycosis (present in at least some rainforest streams at Eungella) must be suspected and a major causes of the extinction of this species.

Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19thâ20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgkâs Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.

20322	Chordata	Mammalia	Eulipotyphla	Solenodontidae	Solenodon	marcanoi	Marcano's Solenodon	3.1	2008		Introduced rats are the most probable reason for the extinction of this species. Fossil deposits of this species have been found with rat fossils. Deforestation, increased human activity, predation by introduced cats and dogs have also been implicated as possible causes of the extinction of this species.
201488	Arthropoda	Diplopoda	Spirobolida	Spiroboleliidae	Spirobolellus	praslinus		3.1	2014		This species was likely threatened by invasive plant species causing habitat deterioration.
177724	Mollusca	Gastropoda	Hygrophila	Lymnaeidae	Stagnicola	pilsbryi	Fish Springs Marshsnail	3.1	2012		This species is considered to be extinct due to slash and burn activities in the 1970s and spring diversion and drainage (Clarke 1991). This species was only known from one spring and is unlikely to be found in any others.
196290	Arthropoda	Arachnida	Araneae	Sparassidae	Stipax	triangulifer		3.1	2014		This species was likely threatened by invasive plant species causing habitat deterioration.
21250	Arthropoda	Malacostraca	Decapoda	Atyidae	Syncaris	pasadenae	Pasadena Freshwater Shrimp	3.1	2013	The habitat of the species throughout its known historical range has been destroyed by channelization and urbanization and now forms part of the Greater Los Angeles area. The species is thus considered to be Extinct.	The habitat of the species throughout its known range has been destroyed by channelization and urbanization.
22696558	Chordata	Aves	Podicipediformes	Podicipedidae	Tachybaptus	rufolavatus	Alaotra Grebe, Delacour's Little Grebe, Alaotra Dabchick, Madagascar Red-necked Grebe	3.1	2016		Several major factors contributed to this species's extinction. The use of monofilament nylon gill-nets at Lake Alaotra has proliferated recently, to the extent that they now cover a large part of the open lake. They undoubtedly kill many diving waterbirds; however the introduction of this fishing method probably only happened after the grebe had already been greatly reduced in number or had disappeared. It is also likely that the introduction of the carnivorous fish Micropterus salmoides and Channa striata has been a major factor in the species's decline and extinction (ZICOMA 1999). Soil erosion from deforested hillsides, agriculture and sedimentation have lowered the water quality of the lake. Introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially Tilapia, probably depleted essential foods for the species (Pidgeon 1996), and natural habitat has been lost through the conversion of marsh areas to rice farms (WilmÃ© 1994). Hybridisation with T. ruficollis, probably a recent colonist from Africa, has occurred in the past and may have been the major contributing factor in this species's decline (Hawkins et al. 2000). Poaching is also thought to have played a significant role in the extinction of the species (WilmÃ© 1994).
21286	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Scincidae	Tachygyia	microlepis	Tonga Ground Skink	3.1	2012		The causes of extinction are believed to be habitat loss, colonization by people of Tonga, along with associated predators such as dogs, pigs and rats.
21530	Chordata	Amphibia	Anura	Myobatrachidae	Taudactylus	diurnus	Mount Glorious Day Frog, Mount Glorious Torrent Frog, Southern Day Frog	3.1	2004		The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like Rheobatrachus silus, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The speciesâ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially mist flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). Taudactylus diurnus was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with Lantana camara or where the weeds Baccharis halimifilia and Agertina riparia (mist flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.
61394	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Cypriniformes	Cyprinidae	Telestes	ukliva		3.1	2006		Introduction of exotic fish species.
21663	Chordata	Reptilia	Squamata	Gerrhosauridae	Tetradactylus	eastwoodae	Eastwood's Longtailed Seps, Eastwood's Whip Lizard	2.3	1996		Afforestation with alien pine species and excessive burning of the the montane grassland habitat may have caused or contributed to the disappearance of this species.
196286	Arthropoda	Arachnida	Araneae	Sparassidae	Thomasettia	seychellana		3.1	2014		This species was likely threatened by invasive plant species causing habitat deterioration.
22728791	Chordata	Aves	Pelecaniformes	Threskiornithidae	Threskiornis	solitarius	Reunion Ibis, Réunion Ibis, Réunion Flightless Ibis, Réunion Solitaire	3.1	2016	This species was found on the Mascarene Islands, but is now considered Extinct having not been seen since 1761. Hunting is likely to have driven its decline.	Hunting is likely to have been the main cause of its demise.
21866	Chordata	Mammalia	Dasyuromorphia	Thylacinidae	Thylacinus	cynocephalus	Tasmanian Tiger, Tasmanian Wolf	3.1	2016	The last known Thylacine died in Hobart Zoo in 1936. Despite numerous, including contemporary, reports of its existence, and several organised searches (e.g. Smith 1980; see SEWPaC 2012), there has been no irrefutable evidence of its survival. There was extensive persecution of the Thylacine because of perceived threat to sheep and fear of a large predator (Mooney and Rounsevell 2008); in latter years collecting by museums and zoos was a major reason for hunting; single-species âpopulation viability analysisâ models are unable to account for the Thylacineâs demise unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate was assumed, even if disease effects were included from 1906 to 1909, however, the Thylacine's demise is readily recreated using the disease-free multi-species metamodels that simulated declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep) (Prowse et al. 2013).	
22698593	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acanthisittidae	Traversia	lyalli	Stephens Island Rockwren	3.1	2016		Construction of a lighthouse on Stephens Island in 1894 led to the clearance of most of the island's forest, with predation by the lighthouse keeper's cat delivering the species's coup-de-grace (Tyrberg and Milberg 1991).
62274163	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Tribonyx	hodgenorum	Hodgen's Waterhen	3.1	2016	This species likely became Extinct during the 17th century as a result of predation by rats and hunting by human settlers.	The main reasons for its extinction are likely to have been predation by Polynesian rats, and hunting by human settlers.
22148	Arthropoda	Insecta	Coleoptera	Curculionidae	Trigonoscuta	yorbalindae	Yorba Linda Weevil	3.1	2014		Historically the species was found in dunes in the Yorba Linda area of California. Due to urban development no suitable habitat remains in the area and the species is extinct.
60792	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Perciformes	Cichlidae	Tristramella	intermedia		3.1	2006		Lake Hula has now been drained.
61365	Chordata	Actinopterygii	Perciformes	Cichlidae	Tristramella	magdelainae		3.1	2006		Drought, pollution and water extraction may have resulted in destroying available habitat for this species.
22708835	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Turdidae	Turdus	ravidus	Grand Cayman Thrush	3.1	2016	This species was known from the island of Grand Cayman, but it has been driven to extinction by logging of its forest habitat. The last sight records date from 1938, and it was definitely Extinct by 1965.	It presumably declined as the island's habitat was progressively cleared (Johnston 1969).
22705595	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Oriolidae	Turnagra	capensis	South Island Piopio	3.1	2016	This species is known from New Zealand's South Island, but is now Extinct as a result of black rat predation. The last confirmed record was of the nominate subspecies, in 1905.	Its extinction was probably mainly due to predation by introduced rats (Greenway 1967), but habitat destruction is likely to have been a contributing factor.
22728820	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Oriolidae	Turnagra	tanagra	North Island Piopio	3.1	2016		Presumably both habitat destruction and direct predation by people, cats and rats caused the species's extinction (Greenway 1967).
91292433	Mollusca	Bivalvia	Unionoida	Unionidae	Unio	madagascariensis		3.1	2016		Pesticides and muds derived from rice field cultivation along the rivers seem to have been the major threats.
22728670	Chordata	Aves	Bucerotiformes	Upupidae	Upupa	antaios	St Helena Hoopoe	3.1	2016	This species formerly occurred on St Helena, but is now Extinct. It was presumably driven to extinction by hunting soon after the island was discovered in 1502.	
22720784	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Fringillidae	Viridonia	sagittirostris	Greater Amakihi	3.1	2016		This forest was cleared for sugar cane, causing the species's extinction (Amadon 1950).
22698580	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Acanthisittidae	Xenicus	longipes	Bushwren, Bush Wren, New Zealand Bush Wren	3.1	2016		Its decline was presumably caused by introduced predators (Robertson 1985), to which it was particularly vulnerable, being a ground-nester (Greenway 1967).
41667	Chordata	Mammalia	Carnivora	Otariidae	Zalophus	japonicus	Japanese Sea Lion	3.1	2015		Japanese Sea Lions were harvested for their skins, whiskers, internal organs, and oil, and were also captured for the circus trade. Those takes, in combination with persecution by fishermen and perhaps shooting by soldiers, likely caused their extinction (Wikipedia 2014).
22728760	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Zapornia	astrictocarpus	St Helena Rail	3.1	2016	This species was known from St Helena, but is now Extinct. It is likely to have been driven to extinction by introduced predators soon after the island was discovered in 1502.	It was driven to extinction by introduced predators.
22692708	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Zapornia	monasa	Kosrae Crake	3.1	2016		Its extinction quickly followed the arrival of rats from missionary and whaling ships in the 1830s and 1840s (Taylor 1998).
22728757	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Zapornia	nigra	Miller's Rail	3.1	2016	This species was known from Tahiti, but presumably went Extinct soon after it was last described in 1784. Introduced predators are likely to have been responsible.	Introduced predators are likely to have led to its demise.
22692672	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Zapornia	palmeri	Laysan Rail, Laysan Crake	3.1	2016		It became extinct on Laysan Island as a result of habitat destruction by rabbits and guinea pigs introduced by guano diggers (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The Pearl and Hermes Reef colony was destroyed by storms; and rats, brought in by wartime activities, exterminated both the Sand Island colony and the Eastern Island colony (Baldwin 1945).
22692693	Chordata	Aves	Gruiformes	Rallidae	Zapornia	sandwichensis	Hawaiian Rail, Hawaiian Crake	3.1	2016		The timing of its extinction indicates that it was perhaps not caused by mongooses, as they were not introduced until 1883. More probably, it was due to a long process of predation by rats, cats, dogs and people (Taylor 1998).
22708535	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Turdidae	Zoothera	terrestris	Bonin Thrush	3.1	2016	This species was formerly found in Japan's Ogasawara Islands, but is now Extinct due to overpredation by introduced mammals. Specimens were collected in 1828, but the next ornithological visit to the islands in 1889 did not locate the species.	Whalers started to use the island in the 1830s and it was probably driven to extinction by introduced rats and cats shortly after (Greenway 1967).
103889155	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Zosteropidae	Zosterops	conspicillatus	Bridled White-eye	3.1	2016		The species's demise is thought to be due to the invasive brown tree-snake Boiga irregularis (van Balen 2016).
22714223	Chordata	Aves	Passeriformes	Zosteropidae	Zosterops	strenuus	Robust White-eye	3.1	2016	This species was endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia, but it is now Extinct due to overpredation by introduced rats. It was last recorded in 1908, and not found on a survey in 1928.	The cause of its extinction was predation by black rats.
